    <h2 id="what-is-homestuck">What is Homestuck?</h2>
    <p><b>Homestuck</b> is a very long webcomic with a quirky style of narration and presentation that makes it <i>look</i> like an old text adventure game—but really, it's just a linear story that you read and watch, barring some of the flash games. People call Homestuck a <i>multimedia</i> masterpiece because it's got musical segments, playable set pieces, cool animations and everything the World Wide Web will allow an artist to put in it.</p>
    <p>The plot of Homestuck is infamously convoluted but boils down to: four kids who know each other online play a video game together, inadvertently causing the apocalypse. To beat the game, they have to interact with the game world's characters, and with a disgruntled group of internet trolls.</p>

    <h2 id="how-to-read-homestuck">How to read Homestuck</h2>
    <p>Fans with a desktop computer use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626173637/https://unofficial-homestuck-collection.carrd.co/">the Homestuck Collection</a> (<a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=51761&p=1">installation guide</a>), a fan-made downloadable archive app which is endorsed by the author, Andrew Hussie, and which includes almost every bit of content listed below. Fans with a mobile device or Chromebook have to use one of the mirrors at <a href="#read-links">the top of this page</a>.</p>
    <p>Why is this? Until 2020, Homestuck used a now-dead technology called Flash to display animated or playable content. When Flash stopped working, the animations and games on the official website were <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/gq94d6/mspaintadventurescom_is_100_dead_now_this_has/"></a>replaced</a> with low-quality YouTube recordings. To restore the comic's Flash features, a couple heroes named Bambosh and GiovanH created a downloadable executable called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626173637/https://unofficial-homestuck-collection.carrd.co/">the Homestuck Collection</a>, available for Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>
    <p>Later, even the bad official website went down in 2024, and is being very slowly fixed by the official team. The mirrors are all that remains.</a></p>

    <h2 id="homestuck-in-order"2>Homestuck in order</h2>
    <p>If you only care about the webcomic, it's fairly straightforward. <b>Start with the first page of Homestuck, stop when you reach the credits.</b> But beyond the webcomic, there's much more!</p>
    <p>Most of Homestuck's side-content is non-canon, but provides additional context or tells entertaining standalone stories. Completionists can use this guide and follow my recommended order. You can also use the <a href="/meta/timeline.html">Homestuck Timeline</a> if you absolutely must read everything in the chronological order it was released (but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626173637/https://unofficial-homestuck-collection.carrd.co/">the Homestuck Collection</a> also presents most of the non-game content that way, so I recommend that first).</p>
    
    <h3 id="recommended-official-homestuck-works">Recommended official Homestuck works</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.homestuck.com/story">Homestuck (2009-2016)</a></b>: The main course. Includes the webcomic up to the credits. Enjoy it with:</li>
      <ol>
        <li><b><a href="https://hsmusic.wiki/group/official/gallery/">The Homestuck Soundtrack (2009-2020)</a></b>: After the fourth volume, over 90% of the soundtrack went unused, so listening to it as a standalone thing (or while reading the comic) is highly recommended. Includes hit tracks by famous Japanese musician Toby Fox, creator of Sans from Undertale.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.homestuck.com/sweet-bro-and-hella-jeff/1">Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff (2009-2017)</a></b>: Maybe almost as famous as Homestuck itself, it's a so-bad-it's-good-on-purpose side comic about a pair of gamers and their silly adventures. Directly and often linked within the comic.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><b><a href="http://hs.hiveswap.com/paradoxspace/index.php">Paradox Space (2014-2015)</a></b>: Non-canonical side comics mostly written by other authors—think Marvel's What If. Stand-outs include <i>Summerteen Romance</i> and <i>The Inaugural Death of Mister Seven</i>.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/623940/HIVESWAP_ACT_1/">Hiveswap (2017-2020)</a></b>: Canonical video game, it tells a side story in the Homestuck universe. Two of a supposed four acts have been released, with the first being widely enjoyed, but the game's <i>extremely</i> troubled development meant the second act was created by an almost entirely different team, released years after the first and widely disliked, with no sign of the other two acts on the horizon. Though not officially announced, I believe this is the only Homestuck project still being worked on as of 2022.</li>
      <li><b><a href="official/skaianet-systems/" target="_blank">Skaianet Systems (2019)</a></b>: A story released as an easter egg in the source code of an official website. It consists of various scraps of canonical lore about one of the Homestuck villains, narrated like a history book, apparently written as worldbuilding material during the comic's run but not released at the time. Highly controversial but recommended.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.homestuck.com/epilogues">The Homestuck Epilogues (2019)</a></b>: Official non-canon prose-only sequel to Homestuck. Controversial events and characterization in spades, but I personally recommend it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="previous-mspa-adventures">Previous MS Paint Adventures</h3>
    <p>Before Homestuck, Hussie wrote three other webcomics in a similar style. While they tell unrelated stories, Homestuck makes references to all of them over the course of its run. You can read these at any time.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.homestuck.com/jailbreak/1">Jailbreak (2006-2007)</a></b>: The first MSPA webcomic. Short and sweet.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.homestuck.com/bard-quest/1">Bard Quest (2007)</a></b>: Even shorter, left unfinished in favour of…</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.homestuck.com/problem-sleuth/1">Problem Sleuth (2008-2009)</a></b>: A much more substantial complete webcomic, excellent in its own right and highly recommended. Starts out as an adventure-game-like parody of hardboiled detective noir fiction, but the situation escalates wildly past that premise.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="informational-homestuck-content">Informational Homestuck content</h3>
    <p>These aren't stories, but rather official social media accounts containing canonical facts and information not revealed within the webcomic:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b><a href="/official/formspring/">Author Formspring (2010-2011)</a></b>: Andrew Hussie's formspring, with a focus on revealing minor details about the webcomic and explaining major ones at length.</li>
      <li><b><a href="/official/tumblr/">Author Tumblr (2011-2013)</a></b>: Andrew Hussie's tumblr, similar to the above but shorter in size.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="official-optional-homestuck-content">Optional official Homestuck works</h3>
    <p>I don't strictly recommend reading all of these, and in some cases like Namco High I actively recommend against it, but for the curious:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b><a href="https://archive.org/details/NamcoHigh_201809">Namco High (2013)</a></b>: Visual novel directed by Hussie. Only here because it has three non-canonical Homestuck routes. In my opinion, the most avoidable thing on this list.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Hardcover-Andrew-Hussie-2013-05-04/dp/B01FKU3IN0">Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff Books (2013, 2018)</a></b>: The first SBAHJ book (now out of print) was just a collector's edition of the main comics with bonus non-story content. A second book, <i>The Quest for the Missing Spoon</i>, came out in 2018, written by Twitter e-celeb @dril. Personally I don't know a single person who thought the second book was funny, let alone worth buying, but some people on Goodreads claim to enjoy it, so, your choice. </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=20932&p=1">Non-canon Snaps (2016)</a></b>: A short sequence of non-canonical comic panels sent through the app Snapchat, made not by Hussie but by some of the Hiveswap team and left unfinished. A skippable curiosity.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/833040/Hiveswap_Friendsim/">Hiveswap Friendsim (2018)</a></b>: Non-canonical visual novel made for the promotion of Hiveswap Act 2, though the characterization and storyline are incompatible with the main game. Features only one volume of writing by Hussie, and the freelance writing doesn't quite measure up to the challenge.</li>
      <li><b><a href="http://homestuck2.com/">Homestuck^2 (2019-2020)</a></b>: A non-canonical sequel to the Homestuck Epilogues. The least official of these, with Hussie's only contribution being a loose outline handed off to some of his friends to revise as they saw fit. Some fans recommend avoiding this—I'd summarize it as trying to be as controversial as the Epilogues, but handled in a puerile way. Early in 2021, future updates were officially called off, with a statement saying it'd continue production in private, albeit slowly. This turned out to be false, but it returned in a way (see Homestuck: Beyond Canon listing).</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144030/Pesterquest/">Pesterquest (2020)</a></b>: Non-canonical visual novel in the style of Hiveswap Friendsim, also including a single mandatory Hussie-written volume, but featuring characters from the original webcomic. In my opinion, some routes in here reach the level of offensively bad (even compared to fanworks) and are not worth wasting your time on.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TheSilenceMill.Psycholonials">Psycholonials (2021)</a></b>: Hussie's most recent work, a visual novel made during/about the 2020 lockdown. Makes a couple of references to Homestuck and reads as a rumination on the fandom, but is otherwise unrelated.</li>
      <li><b><a href="http://homestuck2.com/">Homestuck: Beyond Canon (2023-)</a></b>: A reboot of Homestuck^2 with an entirely different team. Similar in style to the original comic, but still very early, and still requires reading the old team's updates to catch up, some of which <a href="/official/beyond-canon-retcons/">have changed</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Besides these, there are a bunch of high quality unofficial fanworks. Since a summary would be perennially out of date, I recommend just asking the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/homestuck">Homestuck Subreddit</a> or the <a href="https://discord.gg/homestuck">Homestuck Discord</a> for recommendations.</p>

    <h2 id="why-do-people-hate-homestuck">Why do people hate Homestuck?</h2>
    <p>You may have heard Homestuck fans were so bad they got entire hotels and conventions banning them. These claims have never been verified, but it's true that the fandom has been historically quite annoying. I'm going to try to explain why. Take this with a grain of salt—these are only my personal opinions and beliefs.</p>
    <p>Homestuck was an obscure webcomic appealing mainly to Computer Science nerds and Andrew Hussie's previous fanbase until it reached Act 5 Act 1: Hivebent, or The Part With The Trolls, in 2010. The trolls were twelve characters with strong personalities and a simple, recognizable, easily replicable visual template (custom blood colors, horns, zodiac signs on simple clothing).</p>
    <p>Overnight, the makeup of the Homestuck fandom changed. Hordes of teens took over anime conventions, dressing up as the troll who was just like them. Poorly sealed gray body paint, an alien romance system and intentionally abrasive personalities were the perfect trifecta of annoyance to the average con-goer. The recognizable designs pointed people to Homestuck, people got sick of hearing about it, and the hate began to fester. I believe this is the seed of the terrible reputation Homestuck fans get, even when tweens moved on to greener pastures around 2014 as the comic went through endless pauses in content.</p>
    <p>In recent years, Homestuck has kept its negative reputation more as a result of behind-the-scenes problems with the comic and its side projects (in particular the Kickstarter-funded adventure game Hiveswap) boiling over into public drama. Andrew Hussie, the various freelancers he's employed over the years, and the fandom have often had an antagonistic relationship. As of writing, development on Hiveswap is supposedly still quietly ongoing, and two members of the sequel team have nominally taken over as co-directors of Homestuck.</p>
    <p>I encourage everyone reading this to remember: it's just a webcomic, you should really just relax.</p>

      <!--
      <h2>What happened to Homestuck? What's with all the drama?</h2>
      <p>Homestuck has been a thing for 13 years now, and it's no surprise there is a lot of baggage to unravel.</p>
      <p>I won't offer anything besides an abridged summary of the main sources of drama, but I'll include some links to extended essays by better writers at the end. Again, take this with a grain of salt, these are opinions and not necessarily statements of fact.</p>
      <p>This exists solely for contextualization, a small snapshot of many rough spots the fandom went through. Things that brought the author-fandom relationship to the current status quo.</p>
      <p>In rough chronological order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Music Team</b>: Though incredibly talented and responsible for some of the most special parts of Homestuck, it had a rocky history:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Bill Bolin</b>: A musician posted a few unfinished song scraps in a private forum for the team. Andrew Hussie used the scraps in the comic without asking, and Bolin had a massive over-the-top breakdown leading to his removal from the team, as well as his songs from the comic. Known for the meme <i>“YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO TALK PROFESSIONALISM WITH ME”</i>.</li>
          <li><b>Communication breakdown</b>: The music team had been interacting with Hussie amicably and productively until Hussie noticed Toby had a knack for making the right songs he needed in advance. Other music team members had also rubbed the 2011 Head of PR the wrong way. This led to Hussie restricting his interactions with the team, as well as making Toby an unofficial liaison and leader of musical efforts, which he handled reluctantly. This demotivated the rest of the team, and music releases slowed down to a crawl by 2012.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>The 2011 Head of PR</b>: She asked to be forgotten, so I will not refer to her by name. Singlehandledly responsible for most of the drama in early Homestuck history, from absurd copyright crusades to getting into arguments with popular theorists. Perhaps the most famous controversy was when she tried to get online community Gaia Online in trouble for using public domain zodiac symbols in reference to Homestuck. Was known for personally stalking convention stands for Homestuck commissions and getting them banned, as well as manually tagging Etsy one-off merchandise as copyright infringement and laughing about it on Twitter. She left around 2013, but Cindy Dominguez inherited her zeal for frivolous lawsuits and copyright takedowns (see Sarah Z videos). The Homestuck team has been in an adversarial relationship with the fandom ever since.</li>
        <li><b>The MSPA Forums</b>: Long story short, Andrew Hussie hired a few non-Homestuck adults he knew to run the forum, and they weren't paid enough to deal with teens constantly talking about subjects they didn't understand or care about. This caused a lot of friction between the community and the admins, and eventually there was a big split, upon which a big amount of fan content creators moved to Eagle Time and other roleplaying websites. The admins are also responsible for Toby Fox's <i>The Baby is You</i>, an album making fun of the draconian rules governing fanart. It's believed this friction led to the forums being abandoned in 2016 when they were hacked, never to be brought back.</li>
        <li><b>The Homestuck Kickstarter</b>: Andrew Hussie started a Kickstarter in 2012 to fund his Homestuck adventure game. It interfered massively with the creation of the comic proper, to the point I'm confident pointing to it as the silver bullet that killed its popularity. The development of the game itself was <i>extremely</i> poorly handled. See GiovanH's posts for in depth details, or the first Sarah Z video for an abridged version.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Odd Gentlemen</b> (first development team): Allegedly hired before Hussie had any specific tasks to give them, and put to work on the Act 7 Homestuck animation, which was not part of the original deal. When they were done with that and Hussie still had no Game Design Document to give them, they moved on to a different game. They couldn't switch back to Hiveswap the moment Hussie was finally ready, so he threw them under the bus and pointed to them as the guilty party, moving on to a new team and keeping the Act 7 material.</li>
          <li><b>What Pumpkin NYC</b> (second development team): Hussie used the limited Kickstarter money to open game development offices in… Wall Street, New York City. After the first Act of the game was completed, Hussie allegedly decided he simply didn't like the 3D direction he originally approved and fired the entire team with no severance pay, leaving them stranded and a couple millions wasted. Around this time, Hussie is said to have unironically called Homestuck <i>“the next Star Wars”</i>.</li>
          <li><b>What Pumpkin Games</b> (third development team): Headed by Cohen Edenfield and ultimately a comparatively chill period, only marred by Cohen's less than appealing tweeted headcanons. This period ended with HIVESWAP Act 1 being released in 2017 to critical acclaim but limited monetary success.</li>
          <li><b>What Pumpkin Games II</b> (fourth development team): After Viz Media acquired the studio and Homestuck publishing rights for 1.5 million dollars, half of the former team was fired, and they moved to a fully distributed, fully freelance asset-by-asset development. A few bad apples joined the team here, see “Post-Canon Homestuck writing team”. HIVESWAP Act 2 was released soon after with an incredibly reduced budget and to no acclaim at all, and the team seemingly collapsed.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>The Post-Canon Homestuck writing team</b>: Responsible for most of the recent drama in the fandom. The team, refusing to listen to criticism and an ill timed surge of bad actors that spawned from previous drama, sent a significant chunk of the community, especially residing in twitter, against other subgroups and vice versa. Escalated to the point of two team members accusing the Homestuck subreddit and associated Discord Server of being a criminal group in what seemed to be an attempt to take it over and quash criticism (Hussie personally handling negotiations during that period, and later personally walking back the claim). The team was finally driven off by Andrew Hussie and Cindy Dominguez when they tried to start a union.</li>
        <li><b>The Sarah Z Videos</b>: In 2021, a youtuber known for her focus on internet communities, Sarah Z, releases a video on the history of the Homestuck fandom. As a comparatively small part of the video, there are a few references to the Homestuck Kickstarter. Immediately after the video is released, the Homestuck team goes into overdrive, and Cindy Dominguez, executive head of What Pumpkin, sends the youtuber frivolous legal threats. Hussie proceeds to get involved in the whole mess, accidentally admitting to every bad deed the video was claiming. Sarah Z responds by releasing another video about the legal threats and her response to them. This leads to Andrew Hussie allegedly leaving Homestuck forever. Over the following months, there has been no public activity from anyone involved, barring a remark by James Roach on how he's had to stop working on Homestuck projects, the franchise no longer able to bring enough money.</li>
