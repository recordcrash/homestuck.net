Hammerkind.exe will create two files in the same folder as it is stored:

save.hkindsave
DO NOT DELETE THIS, unless you wish to erase all your progress! Feel
free to move, copy and share save files as you wish.

controls.hkindsave
This stores your key configuration.  If you delete this, controls will
revert to default (this can also be done in the menu).  You cannot change
the controls for menu navigation: arrow keys, enter or space to select,
and escape to back out or quit.

If you decompile or otherwise modify or peek into the insides of
Hammerkind, I am okay with that -- though I certainly won't help people
find out how if they don't know.  But I do humbly request that if you
uncover any secrets in your tinkering, do not share them with other
players until they have become widely known.  As much as I sympethize
with the curious who like to crack open something and see what hides
inside, I would much rather the grand discoveries be made by players
finally achiveing an incredibly difficult goal in-game.
