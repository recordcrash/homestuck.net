      <h2>Find your Sburb title!</h2>
      <h5>a quiz by <a href="http://rlabs.tumblr.com/">RLabs</a></h5>
      <p>If you've ever wondered what your Sburb title would be, you've come to the right place! Answer the sixteen questions as accurately as you can. It seems that you get better results if you come up with an answer to the question before looking at the choices.</p>
      <p>All classes and aspects in this test are canon. The descriptions you receive for them are a bit less canonical, however, due to the lack of information about many of them.  If something doesn't look like you've seen it before in the comic, it's almost certainly based on the personalities/actions of the characters in the comic with that aspect.  Note that sharing a title with a character doesn't mean you're necessarily identical to that character; you're simply likely to respond similarly in certain situations. Some of the outfits are wrong and <span class="strikethrough">I'll probably update those someday maybe</span> are left intact for historical purposes.</p>
      <p>God tier images used are credit to Andrew Hussie, original art by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/spectral-ninja/art/Homestuck-Classpect-Chart-NOW-REALLY-MORE-Updated-670933083">multiple artists</a>. Changelog <a href="changelog.txt">here</a>.</p>
    <form name="quiz" class="form" action="javascript:check();">
      <p>Q0: Would you be bothered if you got a class of the wrong gender? (note: this question only determines which classes you can get)</p>
      <input type="radio" name="genderstuff" value="0" checked="checked">No, I don't care if I get a masculine or a feminine class!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="genderstuff" value="1">Yes, I'm female and don't want to be a bard!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="genderstuff" value="2">Yes, I'm male and don't want to be a maid!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="genderstuff" value="3">Yes, I think gendered classes are silly and don't want any gendered options! (warning: there are only six non-gendered classes!)<br><br>

      <p>Q1: Where do you spend the most time online doing Homestuck-related stuff?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q1" value="ACTIVE BREATHTIMESPACEDOOM" checked="checked"> Twitter or the Fediverse, for fast and furious discussion.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q1" value="ACTIVECREATIVE HEARTMIND"> Tumblr or DeviantArt! :3<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q1" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE TIMEVOIDBLOODDOOM"> The Homestuck Discord or <i>a</i> Homestuck Discord.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q1" value="ACTIVE LIFEHOPE"> /r/homestuck, home of walls of text.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q1" value="ACTIVECREATIVE LIGHTHEARTMIND"> Archive Of Our Own, you really like fanfiction.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q1" value="PASSIVEPASSIVE BREATHVOID"> You're not really active anywhere, you mostly just lurk...<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q1" value="PASSIVE LIGHTLIFESPACERAGE"> You don't really use any of those, only smaller or more obscure communities.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q1" value="PASSIVEDESTRUCTIVE HOPEBLOODRAGE"> Why would someone waste their time obsessing over some webcomic?  Nerds...<br><br>

      <p>Q2: What (in your opinion) is the greatest way you contribute to the fandom?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q2" value="PASSIVE BREATHLIGHTDOOM" checked="checked"> Through discussion and IDE/Theories about the plot!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q2" value="PASSIVE LIFEHEARTHEART"> Through discussion and IDE/Theories about characters/relationships!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q2" value="ACTIVECREATIVE SPACESPACEMIND"> Through your super-awesome fanart!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q2" value="ACTIVECREATIVE TIMETIMEMINDRAGE"> Through your hellaciously sweet image manips.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q2" value="ACTIVECREATIVE LIGHTLIFEHOPEDOOM"> Through making things that aren't 2d visual art.  Fanmusic, fanfic, Homestuck websites/applications, cosplay, or something else that isn't specifically fanart is your domain.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q2" value="PASSIVE BREATHVOIDBLOOD"> Through community activities.  Fandom-wide projects, playing on Homestuck servers, hanging out on Discord...<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q2" value="PASSIVEDESTRUCTIVE VOID"> Again, you're more of a lurker and don't really contribute u_u<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q2" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVEDESTRUCTIVE HOPERAGE"> You aren't a lurker, but you know you've made more of a negative contribution than a positive one ;)<br><br>

      <p>Q3: If you could have any of the below powers (in real life), which would you go for?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="PASSIVE LIFEHOPE" checked="checked"> Permanent young adulthood.  You could still die from physical trauma, but otherwise you'd be a normal 25-year-old.  You've always wanted to live forever...<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="PASSIVE VOIDRAGE"> Invisibility.  Think of all the things you could do while invisible...<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="ACTIVECREATIVE LIGHTMIND"> Super-smarts!  Your mind would work significantly faster, and you'd have control over your brain's neuroplasticity.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="CREATIVE SPACEVOID"> You'd be a technopath; manipulation of technology combined with an unbreakable mental internet connection.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="DESTRUCTIVE LIGHTMIND"> Telepathy.  No one will be able to hide any secrets from you!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="ACTIVE TIMESPACEBLOODDOOM"> Telekinesis.  Strong enough to toss around a car, not strong enough to toss a house.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE HEART"> Super-speed.  Never waste time commuting again.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="ACTIVE TIMERAGE"> Time travel, with the catch that you can only go backwards and every second you travel back is a second you spend aging in a pocket dimension, Primer-style.  Beware of paradoxes, and don't go too far back!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE HEARTHOPEBLOOD"> Social awesomeness.  With the right choice of words, you can make anyone love you or hate you.  Manipulate history from the shadows!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" value="PASSIVECREATIVE BREATHBREATHLIFEDOOM"> Flight!  Flying is cool!<br><br>

      <p>Q4: You're bored of browsing the internet constantly, and in a fit of inspiration decide to make a video game instead, learning how to code, make art, and compose music along the way, if necessary.  What kind of video game do you decide to make?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q4" value="PASSIVECREATIVE HEARTLIFE" checked="checked"> A visual novel or similarly mostly-story-based game without a focus on gameplay.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q4" value="PASSIVEDESTRUCTIVE BREATHMIND"> Some kind of turn-based strategy game would be ideal.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q4" value="ACTIVE TIMESPACEHOPE"> An adventure game!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q4" value="ACTIVE LIGHTVOIDHOPE"> An RPG with equal focus on gameplay and storyline.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q4" value="CREATIVE BREATHHEARTDOOM"> A simple retro-style game.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q4" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVEDESTRUCTIVE LIGHTVOIDMIND"> A roguelike or similarly difficult game.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q4" value="ACTIVECREATIVECREATIVE SPACELIFE"> A game with lots of sandbox or cooperative elements.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q4" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE TIMEBLOODRAGE"> A multiplayer competitive game.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q4" value="PASSIVEPASSIVE BLOODRAGEDOOM"> You can't answer this question because you can't imagine yourself making anything more complex than Click the Square to Win: The RPG.<br><br>

      <p>Q5: You're taking a break from your game and browsing the stranger parts of the internet when you come across a link labeled "SBURB Beta".  You're curious and sleep-deprived enough to download the file without thinking too much about the potential consequences.  When you start it up, it turns out to be a working version of Sburb!  Do you play it?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q5" value="ACTIVECREATIVE BREATHSPACEVOIDHOPE" checked="checked"> Definitely!  There's nothing that would be cooler than fighting monsters and becoming a legendary hero with your best friends.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q5" value="PASSIVE BREATHBLOOD"> No, because to be honest there's no way you would survive.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q5" value="CREATIVE TIMELIFEVOIDDOOM"> Definitely not, the chance of creating a new universe isn't worth causing the end of the world.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q5" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVEDESTRUCTIVE HOPEBLOODMINDRAGERAGE"> Yes, because you love the idea of causing the end of the world.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q5" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE LIGHTTIMEHEART"> Sure.  It's not like someone else isn't going to play and cause armageddon if you don't.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q5" value="PASSIVE LIGHTSPACEMIND"> You'd only consider it if you knew the world was going to end soon, whether you personally played it or not.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q5" value="PASSIVECREATIVE LIFEHEARTDOOM"> No, because you care about your friends and family, and you probably wouldn't be able to save all of them.<br><br>

      <p>Q6: Regardless of your choice, some other people decide to start their own session, dooming the Earth to a meteor apocalypse.  Now you have to get some people together to enter the Medium!  Who would your ideal co-player/co-player(s) be?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q6" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE HEARTBLOODMIND" checked="checked"> People who are trained for dangerous situations.  Trained soldiers, climbers, survivalists; doesn't matter as much if you know them personally or not.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q6" value="PASSIVEDESTRUCTIVE SPACEHOPEBLOOD"> No one.  You don't trust anyone else to not fuck everything up, and you'll try to pull yourself in solo.  Time is overrated anyway.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q6" value="PASSIVECREATIVE BREATHSPACERAGE"> Your internet friends!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q6" value="ACTIVECREATIVE TIMELIFEHOPE"> Your real-life buddies!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q6" value="ACTIVE LIGHTTIMEMINDDOOM"> Probably just your best friend or romantic partner.  Things are less complicated with only two players, and you can beat the game as fast as possible.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q6" value="PASSIVEPASSIVEDESTRUCTIVE BREATHVOIDHEARTRAGE"> Your crush...<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q6" value="ACTIVE LIGHTLIFEVOIDDOOM"> As many people as you can possibly pull in.  Best to try to save as many people as possible, even if the game itself becomes a chaotic mess.<br><br>

      <p>Q7: You need to prototype, and you're running out of time!  What do you throw into the kernelsprite?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="ACTIVE LIGHTSPACEHEART" checked="checked"> Your dead pet!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="ACTIVE BREATHSPACEMIND"> The remains of a loved one.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="ACTIVE TIMETIMEHEART"> Yourself.  Now what should you pick for the second prototyping...<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="PASSIVE BREATHHOPEDOOM"> A video game!  You'll never die with Captain Mario Freemanchief at your side.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="PASSIVE LIGHTBLOOD"> Your favorite book, TV show or anime, or related merch.  Always wanted to meet my favorite character in person...<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="ACTIVE LIFEBLOODMIND"> A tissue.  Take that, imps!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="ACTIVE PASSIVERAGERAGE"> The most deadly, powerful-looking thing around.  Your coplayers can just deal with it.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="PASSIVE LIFEDOOM"> Nothing, you'll let your co-player choose what to prototype.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="PASSIVE LIFEHEARTHOPE"> Nothing, because you're not prototyping pre-medium at all.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q7" value="PASSIVE VOIDVOIDRAGERAGE"> Porn.<br><br>

      <p>Q8: Right before you enter, you start thinking about where you're going to end up.  What do you hope your land is like?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q8" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE LIGHTLIGHTHOPE" checked="checked"> A waterworld, full of rocky islands and buried treasure!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q8" value="PASSIVEPASSIVECREATIVE BREATHSPACELIFEVOIDMIND"> Something natural and quiet, free of cities and ruins, with only a few small NPC villages.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q8" value="ACTIVECREATIVE TIMEVOIDDOOM"> Covered in active cities full of crazy amphibious NPCs.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q8" value="PASSIVEDESTRUCTIVE TIMEHOPEDOOM"> A world of ruins begging to be explored, full of weird riddles and puzzles.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q8" value="ACTIVECREATIVE SPACELIFEHEARTMIND"> Trippy neon rainbow world!  Weirder is better.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q8" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVEDESTRUCTIVE BLOODRAGE"> A dangerous world, full of traps that you can use to your advantage.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q8" value="PASSIVE BREATHHEARTBLOOD"> You really don't care, so long as it doesn't immediately start trying to kill you.<br><br>

      <p>Q9: Congratulations, you're in!  What are you going to do now, once you've grabbed a weapon and beat up a few imps for experience?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q9" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE TIMEHEARTHOPEBLOODRAGE" checked="checked"> Alchemizing some rad weapons and beating up larger enemies!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q9" value="PASSIVEDESTRUCTIVE MINDMIND"> Ignoring the normal game for a while and flying out to Derse/Prospit.  Political games are more interesting and productive than just fighting monsters, anyway.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q9" value="PASSIVECREATIVE TIMELIFEVOID"> Opening your computer and building EVERYTHING.  You hope your client player has a lot of grist...<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q9" value="PASSIVE LIGHTSPACELIFEHOPE"> Leaving your house to explore your new Land.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q9" value="ACTIVECREATIVE BREATHLIGHTSPACEVOID"> Grabbing your favorite games and shows and alchemizing as much cool stuff from them as possible!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q9" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE HEARTBLOODDOOM"> Setting up your house's defenses and alchemizing practical stuff.  Always have to be prepared.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q9" value="CREATIVE BREATHRAGEDOOM"> Experimenting with alchemizing to see if you can figure out how to game the punchcard alchemy system for OP items.<br><br>

      <p>Q10: You've reached your first gate, and find yourself in a village full of [insert favorite color here]-colored [insert favorite amphibireptile here]s.  You realize that these are your planet's consorts!  What do you do with them?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q10" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE VOIDHOPEBLOODRAGE" checked="checked"> Become their emperor and god-king/god-queen.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q10" value="PASSIVE LIGHTVOIDBLOOD"> Leave them alone, for the most part.  They probably aren't very helpful; you'd gain more from talking to your friends/your sprite/the internet than wasting time on them.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q10" value="PASSIVECREATIVE BREATHSPACELIFELIFEHEART"> Try befriending some of the locals!  Maybe treat a few of them to a delicious lunch of whatever food you have in your fridge.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q10" value="DESTRUCTIVE TIMETIMEDOOM"> Get straight to business and try to see if they have any awesome items/fraymotifs you can buy from them.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q10" value="PASSIVECREATIVE BREATHHEARTMIND"> Talk with them a while to try to learn more about your land/session's geography and mythos.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q10" value="ACTIVECREATIVE LIGHTSPACEMIND"> Start recruiting them as members of your secret council and travel your land together.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q10" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE HOPERAGEDOOM"> Start killing the bastards before they kill you back!<br><br>

      <p>Q11: You're traveling your planet, searching for your second gate.  You can see it up ahead when a beefy Prospitian, armed with a pair of brass knuckles and a fancy hat, blocks your path.  He looks angry.  What do you do?</p>

      <p>Q12: You and your teammate both have different plots for how to deal with the Dersian royalty.  Your teammate is convinced that their plan is absolutely perfect, while you think it's horrible and stands at least a 90% chance of resulting in one of your deaths.  You've told your teammate why their plan is flawed, but they just try to change the subject and talk about why they don't like your plan.  They've announced they're about to go to sleep and put the first part of their plan into action.  How do you respond?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q12" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVEDESTRUCTIVE LIGHTHEARTHOPERAGE" checked="checked"> Stop them with force if need be.  Yeah, it's dangerous and they could be seriously injured, but it's better then them getting your team possibly killed.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q12" value="PASSIVE LIGHTSPACEDOOM"> Let them do what they'd like, but refuse to help.  You don't want to put yourself in greater danger.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q12" value="PASSIVEDESTRUCTIVE BREATHLIFERAGE"> Help them out with their plan.  Maybe you were wrong in thinking their plan was shitty, and helping them would be less dangerous than letting them execute their plan solo and poorly.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q12" value="CREATIVE SPACEBLOODDOOM"> Keep trying to reason with them; don't use force.  Logic and rationality will always win!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q12" value="PASSIVECREATIVE BREATHTIMEHEARTHOPE"> Call in the rest of your team for support.  They can argue with you, but they can't argue against your whole team.<br>

      <p>Q13: While doing some late-game grinding, you stop to rest inside a cave.  Despite a normal exterior, you discover an interior more akin to a Victorian-era home.  Seated at a desk in front of you is a white horse with no facial features and a green bow tie.  The horse emits a series of telepathic neighs and whinnies, which you immediately understand to be a proposition: The horse will grant you incredible powers, among them super-strength, super-speed, regeneration, and glowy skin, on the condition that if you accept your teammates' sprites will all instantly die.  As you comprehend the gravity of the situation, it laughs a very evil, horsey laugh.  At least, you think it was evil.  What would an evil horse laugh even sound like?  And more importantly, do you make a deal with the (equine) devil?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q13" value="ACTIVEACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE LIGHTHOPE" checked="checked"> Yep!  They'll never know it was you, and you get bitchin' powers.  Sounds like a win-win!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q13" value="PASSIVEDESTRUCTIVE BREATHLIGHTLIFEBLOOD"> No, because you don't actually trust that Bad Horse here is going to keep their word.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q13" value="PASSIVECREATIVE BREATHSPACEHEARTDOOM"> No, because no one has the right to make that kind of decision about other living beings.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q13" value="ACTIVECREATIVE VOIDMINDDOOM"> Yes, because you're pretty sure that you'll benefit your team more with your superpowers than their sprites would.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q13" value="PASSIVE TIMEVOIDBLOODRAGE"> No, because those powers really don't seem worth it.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q13" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE TIMELIFEHOPERAGE"> Yes, because making a deal with the devil for demonic superpowers is awesome!<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q13" value="CREATIVE SPACEHEARTMIND"> You can't decide and leave the glowy pony, deciding to tell your teammates.<br><br>

      <p>Q14: You're now much higher-leveled, with only a bit of preparation and training left to do in your co-player's land before you can face your Denizen.  But before you know it, an incredibly contrived situation unfolds before you!  Your favorite Homestuck kid/troll bursts through an inter-session portal, badly wounded, making a last stand against furious horrorterrors pouring through after them.  At the same time, you see your co-player's house off in the distance being assaulted by high-level enemies.  You know they're inside, and their dreamself is dead.  You only have enough time to save one of them.  Who do you save?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q14" value="PASSIVECREATIVE LIGHTVOIDMIND" checked="checked"> Your favorite character.  You might miss your co-player, but the amount you'd gain from having a high-leveled void-hopping buddy on your side is much greater than what you'd lose from letting your teammate die.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q14" value="PASSIVECREATIVE BREATHTIMESPACELIFEBLOOD"> Your co-player, of course!  They're your friend and you wouldn't let them die.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q14" value="PASSIVEDESTRUCTIVE LIGHTLIFEMINDHEART"> Your co-player; you'll lose the game without them, and the Homestuck-out-of-nowhere seems like too convenient of a distraction for it to not be a trap.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q14" value="PASSIVECREATIVE BREATHSPACEVOIDHEART"> Your favorite character!  You could never let them die in front of you, and you have so much you want to talk to them about...<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q14" value="ACTIVE PASSIVEDESTRUCTIVE"> Your favorite character, because your teammates are tools anyway and you don't care if they die.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q14" value="ACTIVEDESTRUCTIVE DOOMBLOOD">Your teammate, because to be honest as much as you like them your favorite Homestuck character is kind of an ass.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q14" value="ACTIVEACTIVEDESTRUCTIVEDESTRUCTIVE RAGERAGE"> Let both of them die and loot their corpses.<br>
      <input type="radio" name="q14" value="ACTIVECREATIVE TIMEHOPE">You can't accept a zero-percent survival rate, and try to save both, albeit with drastically reduced likelihood of survival overall.  (Each has a 1 in 3 chance of survival, calculated independently of the other.)<br><br>

      <p>Q15: You beat your Denizen and stopped the Reckoning!  Now that you've made a new universe and achieved godhood, you're kinda bored, and decide to mess around a bit.  Through mysterious shenanigans involving a sendificator, a pumpkin, and 2^31-1 pieces of artifact grist, you manage to (temporarily) become Andrew Hussie himself.  You have total control of the comic for one day, and inherit all of Andrew Hussie's artistic ability.  What do you do?</p>
