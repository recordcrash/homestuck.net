CHANGELOG
Version 2.0/Jun 5 2022: Ported to Homestuck.net now that the original is dead,
added more up to date communities to the fandom section and new art. Also, 
made the code more readable in case anyone is interested in that.
Version 1.4/Jul 24 2012: Added five new questions, added some new options and
messed with wording on a lot of bits.  Also made some of the more "moderate"
classes show up more.
Version 1.0/Jul 23 2012: Made the test! (It had ten questions.)
