        <p>Homestuck is big. <i>Really</i> big. It's understandable that people miss things that might be obvious to others with many rereads under their belt. Cataloguing these common pieces of trivia was the duty of the posters at the now dead Obvious Things You Missed threads. This is an archive of everything they felt worth cataloguing, with some modern additions. The MSPA Forums were murdered in 2016, after all.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        Basically Homestuck is really big and really complicated. Occasionally you may make connections on a readthrough or casual skim of the forums that completely went beneath your notice before. When you do, this thread is here. <br />
        <br />
        This is the thread for posting either obvious stuff you missed the first time around or not-so-obvious stuff you wanted to bring light to, unless it happened in the last <b>three days</b>, in which case you are better off in a <font color="Blue"><b>Comic Discussion</b></font> thread.<br />
        <br />
        There will be a hall of fame for some truly amazing  things that may have been missed. For example, If you miss Act 3, you will automatically be rocketed to the top of the leader-board in the &quot;Missing shit&quot; competition. <br />

        - John's shirt turns blue on <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002042" target="_blank">this page</a> due to gif pallette issues (despite what this thread said before, that isn't a compression as such).<br />
        - John does a windy thing <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003387" target="_blank">here</a> (though that might really have been a convenient wind; it is part of the planet's name, after all).<br />

        <b>413/612/1025/2/8</b><br />
        Homestuck began on 4/13/09 and is the reason for 413 showing up all over the story. Similarly, Act 5 started on 6/12/10 and is the reason the Trolls' have 612 as their arc number. Add these two together and you get 1025.<br />
        <br />
        - There are 4 13-year-olds and 12 6-sweep-olds. The beta started on 4/10, hence the chums originally being 10.<br />
        - The kids' first names each have 4 letters and their last names either 6 or 7 (according to their dream planet); adding together 6 and 7 gets you 13. Similarly, the trolls are 6 and 6, for a total of 12.<br />
        - <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003224" target="_blank">The bottom right pool balls spell 413.</a><br />

        - There are 4 suits in a standard deck, each containing 13 cards.<br />
        - In <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002657" target="_blank">[S] WV: Ascend.</a>, Rose's mom inputs what is presumably 413 into the terminal.<br />
        - 4-1=3<br />
        - 4+1+3=8<br />
        - <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003979" target="_blank">Sollux's bees pair up into 2s and their eyes flash beenary.</a> &quot;B&quot; is the 2nd letter in the alphabet.<br />
        - Vriska is the 8th troll in Zodiac order, the 8th troll introduced, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/02542.gif" target="_blank">the 8th to enter the game</a>.<br />

        <br />
        <b>The Felt</b><br />
        The names of the members of Lord English's gang each have significance that is not at once apparent. (taken from wiki)<br />
        <br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">L<img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/o.gif" border="0" alt="" />rd English</font>: A type of spin put on the cue ball. Also retroactively named for Lord British from Ultima, who could only be killed by glitches.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">D</font><font color="#FFFFFF">o</font><font color="#2ED73A">c Scratch</font>: A term for pocketing the cue ball. Also possibly a reference to &quot;old scratch&quot;, an old name for Satan.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Itchy</font>: Named for &quot;ichi&quot;, the Japanese word for one, and as an allusion to the cue sport term scratch. It is also an indicator of his demeanor; he appears tense and high-strung, and is loaded with caffeine.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Doze</font>: Named for &quot;dos&quot;, the Spanish word for two. He also appears quite sleepy.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Trace</font>: Named for &quot;tres&quot;, the Spanish word for three, as well as his ability to retrace people's Past Trails.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Clover</font>: Most likely named for the four-leaf variety of that plant and his leprechaun-like personality and stature.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Fin</font>: Named after a slang term for US five-dollar bills, although the name also recalls his strangely shaped head. It is also possible that he is named for the French or Spanish &quot;fin&quot;, both meaning &quot;end&quot;. He also has notoriously sharp teeth, and, like Trace, resembles a shark. A pool shark.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Die</font>: Named for the number of sides on a standard cubic die, and &quot;die&quot; as in death.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Crowbar</font>: Named for the similar shape of a crowbar and a 7.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Sn</font><font color="black">o</font><font color="#2ed73a">wman</font>: Named for the slang for pocket 8s in poker. Could also be a reference to the similarity in shape between a snowman and the number 8, or possibly a pun (&quot;she's Snowman&quot; is almost a homophone of &quot;she's no man&quot;); her name is also possibly intended as an ironic reversal of her black complexion as a distinctive feature among The Felt members. Sinking the 8-ball ends the game (universe).<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Stitch</font>: Named for the scar on his face, as well as the phrase &quot;a stitch in time saves nine&quot; and the fact that he is a tailor.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Sawbuck</font>: Named after a slang term for US ten-dollar bills, which, like Fin, probably comes from the shape of his head.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Matchsticks</font>: Named after the fire producing sticks, because of his powers to appear at whatever time and place that there is a fire. Matchsticks also look a lot like the number 11.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Eggs</font>: Named for the most notable product served in a dozen, and his eggtimer.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Biscuits</font>: Named for a baker's dozen, and his oven.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Quarters</font>: Named for &quot;quatorze&quot;, the French word for fourteen, but also for the money as when he got introduced, quarters were shown to be used by the Felt to summon each other.<br />
        <font color="#2ED73A">Cans</font>: Named for &quot;quinze&quot;, the French word for fifteen. "Can" is a boxing term, equivalent to "jobber", someone who is there only to lose.<br />

        <b>Common Misconceptions</b><br />
        - Karkat's blood is at the bottom of the hemospectrum. Or the top. {It is nowhere; he is a mutant and hence treated the worst.}<br />
        - Dave is an albino. {He shows traits of it, but Andrew has stated on Formspring that he's not an albino but just blond. Also, he would probably not be able to function in his light-filled city or land, stare directly into a bright dream bubble, see as clearly as he has been shown to, etc..}<br />
        - Tavros has <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004016" target="_blank">what appears to be a bucket</a> on his jousting thing. {It is a can, likely an old game container or can of Grub Sauce.}<br />
        - The Batterwitch was the Witch of Life in the pre-Scratch session. {Feferi is the Witch (of Life), her ancestor is the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005961" target="_blank">Batterwitch</a>.}<br />
        - There is troll blood in the coffee. { No, just the alluded-to oily film that coffee develops. Employee tumblr post saying so <a href="https://pluckyminna.com/post/19389442876/blood-or-oil">here</a>. [EDITOR NOTE: Worth noting that Hussie said otherwise in his commentary, proving even he managed to forget what he was going for.] }<br />
        - Trolls don't write English. { <a href="http://mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004958" target="_blank">Vriska can read English text just fine.</a> }<br />
