1927 - Putting Pants on Philip 

HIC and Jane are on a rare outing together, just for fun. Jane is a very surly teen, who has to get dragged out of the house by HIC to do anything together. They decide to go see a movie. The film "Putting Pants on Philip" is playing. It's the first appearance of Laurel and Hardy in a film together. Jane suddenly wide eyed with excitement at the sight of Laurel, who she still fancies. But to her surprise, HIC is laughing uncontrollably through the entire film. It's the most she's ever heard her laugh. In fact, she's not sure if she's ever heard her laugh. She just thinks it's the funniest fucking thing she's ever seen. She absolutely MUST know who that delightful fat clown man is. He must be brought to her immediately. Jane thinks this is all a little weird, but whatever. It's a good excuse to call Laurel. 

Laurel, summoned by Jane and asked to bring Hardy, won't pass up this opportunity to go undercover inside the Crocker network. He has not been able to stop thinking about HIC since he saw her. At this point, he's confused about whether he wants to infiltrate to serve Chaplin, or whether he just wants to be close to her. On arriving, he quickly realizes that all of her affection is for Hardy. He begrudgingly must accept her affection for his partner in order to stay in her service though. Both he and Hardy are hired as her two right hand men, just as the James brothers once were. Although this time, only Laurel would do the legwork. Hardy would be kept exclusively as her lover, though he was effectively a sex slave.
