1996 - Jane and Jake

Jane and Jake arrive in 1996 via meteor, instead of John and Jade. Jane is raised by a genetic copy of the same man who she gave birth to in the previous timeline. He was raised by John Crocker and some woman he married immediately after leaving the Crocker compound in terror, after seeing Hitler's severed head sitting on a desk. Jake lives on the island, taken there by Jade. HIC starts conditioning Jane with propaganda and mind control technology.
