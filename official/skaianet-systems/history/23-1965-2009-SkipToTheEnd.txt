1965-2009 - Skip to the End

The clone experimentation continues. Jake marries a woman by the name of Claire in the late 70's. Starts yet another family. Needs to stay local to a lab, to continue development of some incredibly advanced software. Software that still needs computer tech to be developed well enough to support it. SN's tendrils continue to influence all sectors of the tech world to make that happen. He's recruiting some enterprising employees of SN at a very young age, just like his old lady did. He just set up an infant from the sky named Dirk down in Texas with a trust fund, setting him on a path to be of use to the company. Then he moved up here to New York to do the same for another kid named Roxy. He's been making good headway on his quest for the mysterious island in the pacific. Once everything is taken care of here, he'll leave this family behind and set up shop on that island permanently. That's when the real work begins. The discoveries on that island will finally unite him with the destiny he's been in search of his whole life.

Prior to his discoveries on the island, Jake has no idea this will result in some kids using the software he's unearthing, which will destroy all life on Earth. Nor does he have any idea that those kids will be using this same software to reboot the universe with different starting conditions, thus ending this "trial run" timeline for HIC, and giving her a fresh start. Exactly as she planned.
