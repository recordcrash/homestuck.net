1961 - Next Phase

HIC reveals to Laurel the next phase of her plan. Without Jake's knowledge (most things are done without his knowledge), she has carved out a vast portion of Skaianet's industrial infrastructure to facilitate a massive cloning project. She takes him to a new cloning plant near the Crocker compound, gives him a tour, and explains his new responsibilities. From now on, attending to the advancement of this project must be his only concern. He wonders what she's cloning, but she doesn't say. It will take additional years of development.
