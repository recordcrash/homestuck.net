                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-cynicalpsionic"><strong>Q:</strong> I've found that one of the biggest hanging questions of the original ending, which some of the old patreon updates touched on, is how this new world was put together.<br><br>I understand that this is a story about kids and their kids now, but Earth C is... Well, The Earth. And apparently it was segmented into four kingdoms? Where are those kingdoms? How have they run for 5,000 years while the kids skipped ahead?<br><br>Jane is Not-President in one world, but is actually president in the other? Is that of the whole world? What's the actual power structure and geography at work?<br><br>Put simply: Is there a desire to dig into the worldbuilding of Earth-C in both timelines, to explain how it all functions as a society, beyond the patreon update that effectively said "Automated Socialism, but no longer"?</p><p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> I think that a lot of how we want to explore this is in the way that the omega kids talk to each other.  I'm hoping to have them pepper a lot of references to the society they came from into their dialogue so as to let us allude passively (and occasionally actively) to that world.<p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Miles said it best, there is definitely thoughts and discussions we've had about Earth C but one of the things I love about Homestuck is how it feeds this information to you in really natural ways.</p>

But I, and likely dozens of other fans, want to know something much more important to Homestuck: What are some of the things the team is excited about making WORSE?</p><p class="answer author-hsbc_crew"><strong>ANDI:</strong> grins evilly</p>

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-fearshatter"><strong>Q:</strong> James: What pushed you and the others into picking this project back up?<br><br>
                  Kim: Are you intending to push for new artstyles that mirror the spirit of Homestuck but defy the usual conventions (as you guys have so far) similar to how Hussie continued to try and innovate new styles for various moments?<br><br>Andi, Chumi, Haven, and Floral: Who's your favorite character to draw, and do you have a favorite godtier outfit you're looking forward to drawing?  And/or a favorite moment?<br><br>Haven, Floral, and Miles: Who are your favorite characters to write, and how do you feel about your grasp on them?  Are you looking forward to growing the universe and seeing where it goes and how you can further defy narrative conventions and embody the spirit of HS in your own way?<br><br>
                  Kohi: How is it working on the web treating you?  Are you looking forward to the possibility (slight, but not out of the question) of breaking a site again like Hussie did by working together on this project?  Further, what sites do you wish you could advertise HS^2 on if you could?  Alongside this, what kinds of difficulties do you have to deal with maintaining the servers and site?</p>
                  <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> I think the easy answer is we just really love Homestuck, also Andrew asked me specifically to do it. I handpicked this team because I thought they truly understood what made Homestuck good. Wow they are typing so much in this google doc. I'm watching the words fill out like little ants.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> Absolutely! I've been thinking a lot about this actually! Homestuck is such a living piece of work that's constantly evolving, including the artwork as well. I love that while so far we have been drawing in a way that is very reminiscent of Andrew Hussie's early Homestuck art, I really wanted to emphasize to all the artists that we should also strike a balance taking a lot of our own artistic liberties and just go crazy with it illustratively. No spoilers, but there's a certain part of the story we DEFINITELY want to go wild and experimental with it LOL.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> My favorite character to draw is Jade!!! Harley!!! hehe. ‚úåÔ∏è Other than the obvious answer, probably Aradia! And a favorite GTier outfit.... I'd say Vrissy's! Take that as you will, hehe.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-andi"><strong>ANDI:</strong> I really like drawing Aradia, I love drawing big hair. She's very fun!! I don't like a lot of god tier outfits lol. But when I do draw them, you know I'm gonna go incredibly hard..
                <br></p>
                  <p class="answer author-haven"><strong>HAVEN:</strong> my favorite characters to draw in fanart are dave, karkat, vriska and aradia but since starting working on the comic panel-wise my favorite characters to draw are The Alternate Calliope and kanaya. I'm looking forward to drawing vriska's god tier more.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Personally, I really gravitate towards Space players along with John. They really lean into my wheelhouse with how subtle their voices are. Not to mention I love ‚Äú""nice""" characters because their motivations require a lot of nuance. I also love writing Karkat because he's closest to my own sense of humor. <br>I am so so excited to work with the universe of Homestuck. I love the themes of OG HS so much and I love discussing what it means to make a story. *rubbing my hands together*<br>As for the art question, I love drawing Jade, Kanaya and Karkat 8). Jade is one of my fave godtier outfits too.
                <br></p>
                  <p class="answer author-haven"><strong>HAVEN:</strong> honestly it's kind of a cop out answer but i really love writing literally every character, this is all a dream come true. I find myself enjoying every character more as i get chances to write them, recently The Alternate Calliope in particular has been really fun for me.
                <br></p>
                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> I love writing almost anyone, but I think one of my surprise new passions has been writing Dirk, who hasn't shown up much at all in the comic yet, but (spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!) will.  Everyone is fun, though.  I think one of my best strengths as a writer is character voice, to say nothing of the fact that I'm one of the millions of us who has a Homestuck Lobe of my brain.<br>Where the story/universe is concerned, I am more excited than you could possibly fucking imagine.  We have some really, really incredible stuff coming both insofar as we're continuing the plot we inherited and jumping into new stuff.  It's a huge honor, folks on the team can tell you that I'm constantly geeked about it.
                <br></p>
                  <p class="answer author-kohi"><strong>KOHI:</strong> Working on the site has been pretty rewarding! As far as breaking the site goes, obviously that's something that no web developer wants to see happen, but the Homestuck fandom takes it in stride and finds it more amusing than detrimental. With site maintenance difficulties, the biggest challenges are  making sure to respond to any alerts that pop up for our VPSes, as well as any new CVEs that pop up. Y'know, typical routine routine webdev stuff.</p>

                  <p class="answer author-andi"><strong>ANDI:</strong> But really, if its gonna happen, we need to make homestuck even bigger than the peak of 2014. If we can do it once, we can do it again, yall have crashed websites before. C'mon. Don't you wanna see that limited edition god tier john skin hit the griddy? Could you imagine a vrillyhoo pickaxe?</p>
                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> You guys are literally our only hope of this.  Please don't let us down.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> demand homestuck in fortnite anyway heres what im thinking for the first drop. Typically fortnite collab drops come in threes. Obviously John has to be one, but we have to have at least one troll. I'd say Terezi, because she has the most alt outfits. Backbling would be a perfectly generic object or Casey. The emote would be a traversal Ghost Pogo Ride</p>

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-johnvantas"><strong>Q:</strong> Hi James. Can we expect interactive (Flash) pages in the near future? I do understand it's not as easy as it sounds but I'm still curious.</p><p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> ‚ÄúNEAR?" future? How about this. We have at least one planned. I'm committing everyone to it by saying this.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-suspiciousmrguy"><strong>Q:</strong> Many of you have been involved in homestuck fanworks in the past (and continuing into the present.) How different does it feel, working on HSBC? Does it feel basically the same as working on fanworks, or does the level of "official-ness" make it feel different for you? How much of a dividing line do you draw there, mentally? I'm interested in all of y'alls personal perspectives on this!</p>
                  <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I would say it's quite different! The ‚Äúofficialness" is something that's a little intimidating for me, knowing that this thing I've drawn will be seen by many, MANY people and forever regarded as canon. It does affect how I tackle each storyboard and panel. Of course it's still very exciting though! Being part of Homestuck is a dream come true, and I want to convey how much I love our stuff and Homestuck through my work! I'd say I'm learning a lot! üòÄ</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> It's definitely different making something as a fan vs making something officially LOL. I think what's important to consider is that since a wider audience is involved, you have to take into account that a lot of story decisions are now very crucial. Especially if there's anything I know from being a fan of Homestuck of 10+ years, we as fans LOVE to theorize on all the little details‚Äì so we gotta be very intentional too! I'm very much the kind of person who loves to play in the realm of non-canon, so I very much compartmentalize what I'd like to keep for myself as a fan to play with VS. what we make canon.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kohi"><strong>KOHI:</strong> There are a lot of similarities that carry over between any kind of collaborative work like this, but the fun has been seeing the different workflows and processes that the members of the team have brought with them. This is a craft where you're always improving yourself and those working with you through these nuances. The ‚Äúofficial-ness" brings with it an inherent weight of responsibility, sure, but I think we'd be giving our best work regardless.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Personally, with my fanwork projects that process is definitely a bit different and I actively try to approach it differently too. With the Liminal Space comics, the mentality is to interact with the source material in a format and subject style that is contradictory. It's all about the inbetweens and the quiet moments of Homestuck canon. Fanwork feels like a suggestion for other readers to try out a new perspective. The fun of official work is separating from that and working with the larger team about what feels right and true. It's not about ‚Äúlook at this fun thought I had" but moreso how I would approach original work. ‚ÄúThis is a functioning, finely tuned narrative that people will be interacting with as source material." It's really fun this switch up and I love working on Homestuck with other people. Fa work is isolating honestly(at least how ive always done it)  but now we can all celebrate and be excited together.</p>

Looking at our plans for the plot structure right now I can't imagine it's going to take us less than three years of regular updates, but it could end up stretching longer.  You're going to be happy for that, trust me.  I'm gonna be saying this a lot, but we have So Much Neat Shit to get through. </p>

It's a story that hit me HARD when I started reading back in 2010 and was my whole life for a while.  It remains one of my favorite stories ever, so getting to continue it and put some of myself back into it is a dream come true and feels very full-circle for me.  Like, I get to write this now?

The possibilities are honestly limitless within this universe, and I just love to create within it and that's what constantly keeps me invested and coming back as a creative. I think I'm honestly chasing the high of how creatively inspired the fandom was back in 2014, and it'd be so cool if we can continue to reach that audience of people who feel that creativity.</p>

                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> I also first read it in 2011 when I kept seeing this Karkat guy showing up everywhere in my DeviantART feed and I needed to know who these gray motherfuckers were. I'm honestly pretty consistent with my interests, even when my interest would have waned for a couple years, I always had a foot in the door for the fandom.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> I mentioned this earlier but I started reading in 2010.  I caught up right before Bec Noir happened and that whole era leading into and including murderstuck was one of the best times to be an active reader in the entire life of the comic, at least in my experience.  I knew I was obsessed at the time, but I think it'd still surprise young me how long I'd care.  If I could travel back in time and tell myself I'd be writing the sequel I think young me would like... shit himself.  </p>

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-yuei2"><strong>Q:</strong> How big do you think relationships will play into this? I think romantic relationships have always gotten a lot of love in the comic, but due to the nature of comic parental/authority and kid relationships were very barely present. <br><br>Something that makes HS:BC unique to me especially comparing it while re-reading the original is that all all adults existing alongside their children + the mid-20 something's version of of the adults to on the other side.<br><br>Should we expect more of the same distance when taken to relationships between adult and children as HS? Or can we look forward to like adults and children working together having developed relationships between two people not a child and vague authority figure?<br><br>Also does anyone on your staff like/love Alt-Calliope? <br><br>She is low key one of my favorite characters and I feel both her and Calliope were dreadfully under utilized. Alt-Calliope being malicious and yet ‚Äúgood" and having it out with Jade is low key one of my favorite post-comic moments.</p><p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> We definitely are gonna be ruminating pretty heavily on the parent-child relationships, and as you pointed out the adults this time are Full Characters who are themselves going to be having their own arcs and adventures, but these groups (the kids vs the adults) are going to merge and subsequently distance themselves from each other pretty often and chaotically over the course of the narrative.  A lot of these intergenerational relationships are things that the individual characters might need to work through themselves.  Homestuck gives a lot of responsibility to people to work their own shit out, then converge and sort of... emotionally compare notes.  Also, we fucking love Alt-Calliope, and I get the feeling that after we're done you're gonna love her even more.  </p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> What fun about Homestuck is that despite the game actively putting distance between children and their guardians, the guardians are always present in how the kids approach playing the game. Especially with the 4 betas. And personally that's one of the things I love about it. Also Alternate Calliope fucking rules.</p>

A really interesting observation about the ‚ÄúHomestuck art style" is that... it has always been visually all over the place, and that's what makes it fun! It's daring! It's experimental! Of course, there's lots of recurring stylistic ticks, but there's no singular art style‚Äì if that makes sense. I think all the artists on the team have a mutual understanding where we wanna go with it visually too, but the most important thing we all have to remember‚Äì you gotta have fun with it!!!</p>

If not, will that be replaced by "acts" or something else? How should the story's parts be referred to, for example should we call the first 15 Chapters Homestuck^2, and everything onwards Homestuck: Beyond Canon?<br><br>Any plans on adding an adventure map for HSBC?</p><p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> We've been internally thinking of HSBC in Acts, and we're probably gonna crystallize that going forward.  For reference, everything that's happened in HS^2/HSBC up til now would be considered to be part of HSBC Act 1.  I believe we'll be delineating these things pretty clearly In-Comic, so over time/in retrospect it's gonna be pretty clear.  You'll know when an Act has ended, and when a new one is beginning.  As for what you should call the first chapters, I think you can sort of unofficially call those chapters ‚ÄúHS^2" if you want to refer specifically to that as a production era, but Homestuck: Beyond Canon is gonna be the name of the whole story, and HS^2 is the first part of That Story.</p>

                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Meetings and meetings and meetings and meetings.

Though, of course, the writing team spearheads it and have their own pipeline process LOL. When it comes to the art, it's a whole back and forth process with the artists making their boards and sketches for the update. I would constantly correspond with the artists, as I help overlook and make sure all the boards read clearly and unifies the overall visual intention for the comic.</p>

A few questions if that's okay :)<br><br>1) What's the internal thoughts on the younger skew of the fanbase, especially when most of the content within the comic and Beyond Canon comic itself is geared towards older and adult readers? Will it continue being for older readers, or will it be a bit more sanitized/for all ages? I'd prefer to have it more adult still personally, but that's for you guys to decide ultimately .<br><br>2) Are there any updates on a gacha-type game you've discussed a few times, just as an idea? Or any other merch plans you can share?<br><br>3) Thank you for being nice to Roxy. Not a question ig.</p><p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I think our main priority is writing a story that's loyal to our vision. Since it so happens that HS:BC is currently exploring a lot of ‚Äúadult" themes, HS:BC so far has been more adult-oriented. Of course, as the course of the story progresses, this is subject to change just as the themes of the story change! We're working on merch ideas, but that'll probably come at a later date, since we're more focused on settling in right now. Gacha game, we think about it all the time, at every meeting.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> For your first question, Chumi put it best, I think we're simply focused on just trying to tell a good story. I don't think ‚Äúsanitizing it" is our goal or the right way to put it either, but we just want to tell our story honestly, ykwim? And sometimes, those topics may touch upon more mature themes!</p>
                  <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> The thing about young people is that they just keep making new ones. Audiences are always gonna skew ‚Äúyoung" and thats cool man. I read things that were meant for older audiences as a kid, and theres very little we can do to stop kids from reading it. I think the best we can do is make it clear this intended for an older audience and cater it to that intended audience.<br><br>As far as a gacha game we half-joke about it.

I know Hussie has largely washed his hands of HS (in a creative capacity, anyway), and we'll almost certainly never see a complete collection of HS books, but do you know if there's any possibility that we'll see a continuation of his author's notes in any form? I totally understand if he just wants to move on from talking about HS/making HS content himself, but I would love to see them on the Patreon or as a paid-for plug-in for the unofficial collection, or something else like that.<br><br>2. Is there any chance we ever get to see any of Homestuck's story bibles/development documents? Every time James mentions the classpect one, my Hunger grows. I know James always wanted to make a SBURBology-style guidebook, which would essentially be those sorts of documents turned into an actual product. Now that James directs the HICU, might SBURBology finally see the light of day?<br><br>3. On a related note, what's everyone on the team's dream HS merch? Besides SBRUBology, I would personally kill for Nendoroids of all my little blorbos.<br><br>4. What's everyone on the team's dream HS-related project?

I don't want to get too into stuff just yet without working some stuff out on the back-end, but we'd very much like to see the author's notes continued and are actively looking into avenues to explore that.  We'd love to have some good news for you guys on this front early next year, but no promises.  As for question 5, I love writing Tavvy.

What's hardest I'd say is distancing yourself from what popular fan readings say and finding your own voice. Except I also love that.

It's actually been enormously helpful for me in terms of seeing how developed my understanding of these characters is and testing where it makes sense for us to take them.  As for who to give the aux I was gonna answer Dave, originally, but I don't know that this is a safe thing to do.  I'm changing my answer to Equius, because you know he's listening to a bunch of heavy shit.  Cybergoth industrial.  Hardstyle.  Dubstep.  Prog metal.  Headbanger shit.  </p>

                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> We get to balance both.

                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> Before the hiatus, I definitely feel like the art was a lot more standardized‚Äì which isn't a bad thing, per se! There's a convenience to having the art very streamlined, but of course that would mean there's a limitation to what we can do as artists. I've always admired the experimental aspect of Homestuck's art, and I hope we can re-introduce that within Beyond Canon again!</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Personally I love the challenge of writing with pre-establish styles. The main draw of being in fandom is the interaction between the author's original vision and then working within those parameters while being true to myself. Respect to source material is paramount imo. And considering a core part of Homestuck's charm is reveling in authentic author voices and the constant push to break convention, the very format of Homestuck requires embracing new frontiers.

I was just a little commission artist doin some freelance here and there. Then I got invited to do some sprites on Pesterquest, and then HS2 artwork. And now I'm here on HS:BC! </p>
                  <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I've been doing freelance art for maybe a decade and convention tabling for awhile as well! I've also worked on multiple HS-related projects, canon (HS Cafe, Act 6 Tarot Deck on FFBF when it still existed), non-canon (zines), and fan-adventure related. This experience also expands to non-HS projects! I just like getting involved in projects, so I've done LOTS of random stuff here and there.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> I've done storyboards and board revisions for HBO Max, and have worked on several indie productions (mostly for games) doing a variety of things like character designs, illustration, and animation! I was brought on-board working on Homestuck since I was in college, so there's also just a lot of Homestuck in my professional resume too LMFAO.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> When I was in my early 20's I used to work in a country club as a manual laborer, basically just picking up heavy things and moving them from one place to another. I was a music teacher for a while. I worked in insurance briefly but hated it. I've been doing music for webtoons and stuff under various names since I was in my teens. I worked as a sound mixer on Steven Universe: Future, and have done a lot of music for pitches and pilots etc. I wrote on Pesterquest and Hiveswap a little. I've done a lot of things behind the scenes as well but thats not as exciting.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> I have my fancomic project Liminal Space and have been in an array of fanzines like the Phantasmic Youngsters. Outside of Homestuck, I've done Original Character Tournaments and 1 silly try at a webcomic in my early 20's. I've worked so much food service to pay for school.</p>

My opinion is that his design would look much better with it and it's so painful to read that he had it and shaved it off before we could see it! And on a related note, are there any plans for the kids to start resembling the guardians more?</p><p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Jake 'stache-mogged him.  It's kind of devastating.  I think trying to come back from that would be an arrogance even John is incapable of.  It's like, you're both sort of sadsacks but one of you is a thick muscle hunk and the other one is his schlubbier look-a-like, you don't wanna add salt to the wound of that comparison by growing a weaker mustache.  I feel you, though.  Facial hair is a good look.  Underutilized.</p>

                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> I can tell you who's NOT cool.  I saw Dirk at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you're doing now?" I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?" but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?" and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Orange Fantas in his hands without paying.<br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first." At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.<br>When she took one of the bottles and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence," and then turned around and winked at me. I don't even think that's a word. After she scanned each bottle and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</p>

The ‚ÄúToblerone Wish" just happened to line up with what was already going to happen. So Andrew ‚ÄúConfirmed" it. This is true of a lot of homestuck stuff, actually.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> From what I know, June has definitely always been planned since the beginning even within the prior team, and her transition is technically a spoiler that Andrew revealed early on and, while we understand the hype (I'm hype too!), but we gotta let it cook within the story!</p>

We had it cookin‚Äô in the pre-production stage for a good hot second, but the actual production was three and a half months long. It was definitely a valuable learning experience!

I can't believe how well ye've balanced homage to and continuity with OG and previous Homestucks with freshness, surprise and new personality in both art and writing.<br><br>My q: I became a dad since reading the previous incarnations of Homestuck, and it's been a total change in my worldview. I think about this in particular in connection with BC's focus shifting away from the OG characters towards the omega kids. I wonder if this story decision came from similar transformative experiences you guys have had, or if there have been any other transformative experiences you guys have or want to incorporate into the story. Thanks!</p>
                <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> Congratulations on becoming a dad!! What a life-changing event!! üòÄ I would say that growing up in general has influenced how I interpret Candy specifically. I started reading Homestuck when I was like 12 and I‚Äôm 27 now, just as the kids started as 13 year olds and are now in mid-life in Candy. I am a different person now! Some changes were for the better, some for the worse. My favorite characters are different, older people now, and it‚Äôs been so interesting to explore why and how it happened. I think HS:BC reflects parts of my own experience with growing up, becoming different, and reconciling with that. Additionally, as someone who is a ‚Äúfandom figure(?)‚Äù, thinking about my self-perception versus how my audience perceives me. It‚Äôs been slightly touched on with Jade, how it feels to be an eternal celebrity and how their image of her differs from her actual self. I have a lot of thoughts, but I‚Äôll leave it at this for now HEHE.</p>
                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Serious congrats on your new journey of fatherhood! I think, as Chumi mentioned above, that our own journeys through childhood and also through the growing up of Homestuck itself as a story and a fandom are absolutely huge influences on what we‚Äôve done and where we hope to go with the rest of the story.</p>

                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Definitely. Jake is definitely a ‚Äúsafer‚Äù public figure to be obsessed with but Karkat is the kind of sexy countercultural hero that can‚Äôt help but get a lot of play in Earth C society, notorious rogue that he is... we put a little tidbit in the last update about Jane having to spend a lot of time smearing him in the media because otherwise his rugged proletariat charisma would probably just run rampant through their society. I‚Äôm sure all the gods deal with this on some level, but Karkat sort of occupies a special echelon (a spechelon) where this is concerned by virtue of his controversial role in their current history. Sorry for spending a bunch of time writing about how Karkat‚Äôs hot bod challenges society.

I had a conversation with Andrew about this recently and how Homestuck came into itself in an era that doesn't exist anymore. The way we interact with things online has fundamentally changed and evolved and in order to remain "relevant" homestuck, and the very nature of it being "a webcomic" would have to evolve as well. It is very easy to say things like this because I don't know what that would even mean. I'm not gonna be out there making homestuck dance tiktoks or doing like corporate social media viral engagement bait shit. that sucks and nobody wants that. but homestuck has always kind of been an experience that extends beyond the pages of a webcomic<br>anyway, i am interested in seeing how we evolve both as a property and a community.</p>

                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> From most to least crazy? Hmmm... Jane probably takes the cake here for outlandish, but I think Rose and John are dealing with more like... mind-alteringly intense existential problems, and are less Stable. Jade is being pushed pretty far emotionally by the hole she‚Äôs dug herself into, but I think she‚Äôs fundamentally got her shit together, she‚Äôs just really upset. Kanaya is definitely angrier than Jade, but I think still able to hold herself together more. Roxy, by contrast, is less angry than Kanaya, but more... out of touch? I wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs crazy but she‚Äôs also deep in the cope-realm and still needs to absorb the reality of what‚Äôs happening. Jake is seeing a lot more clearly recently than he has in a while, but I think the excitement of making all these new stressful steps probably has him feeling shaky. Callie is just vibing but again, priorities are a little mixed up. Karkat is probably who I‚Äôd consider to be near the most adjusted right now. Angry and tired and stressed out, but he‚Äôs got a good head on his shoulders, he‚Äôs thinking solution. Meenah is chilling, honestly. Shit‚Äôs all worked out great for her.

                <p class="question author-hatster401"><strong>Q:</strong> Why was it decided to move from Requiem to a very similar but smaller venue doing a shorter event?</p>
                <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> The original event was back during the VIZ days, and we didn‚Äôt have much creative control over it. VIZ got paid a small percentage of overall sales that was not extended to WP, though some of us participated in a freelance capacity. We wanted to do something with a bit more creative control, but the second Requiem cafe event was already in motion before we could plan otherwise. We were more interested in doing something on a much smaller scale that would be easier to keep track of ourselves, and the Requiem events ballooned to be weeks long with very little oversight from anyone tied to Homestuck. We declined to do the event again back in October, and decided to move forward with another opportunity presented to us in H&B. They do much more focused pop-up events like this all the time, and it was more in line with what we wanted to do originally.</p>
                <p class="question author-lupocani"><strong>FOLLOWUP:</strong> Thanks for providing some insight on this. That said, the choice seems baffling and frustrating from the point of view of an attendee.<br><br>

                Requiem's 4/13 has been held twice. Both times it sold out, both times it was beloved by those who went. By a margin of six months or so, it's been an important thing for many homestucks for longer than Beyond Canon has. It's been the closest thing we might ever have to a "real" Homestuck convention, and it's not even that big ‚Äî it hosts, what, just over a hundred people?<br><br>

                Wanting an event where you're more involved makes a degree of sense ‚Äî but going out of your way to replace the only real physical Homestuck party with an even smaller one (and with an untested concept besides) seems incredibly strange. Does H&B even have the space and facilities for people to gather and talk like Requiem does? Will they be able to host performances? Especially when demand is as high as it is ‚Äî if H&B is even smaller, surely both could sell out! That's what you'd want, when growing a fandom.<br><br>

                Perhaps there are more detailed reasons you haven't shared, but currently the situation just seems weird, almost like the more popular event has been sabotaged to make way for a more closely held one. Like Requiem, I wish H&B all the best for their party ‚Äî but I'll miss the old one, and I sincerely hope you'll give them the chance to host again in the future.
                </p>
                <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> You know, that's fair. I recognize the Requiem event was special for a lot of people and to their credit they hosted a fun event in a space that could handle something like that.<br><br>

                I think "replace" is the wrong sentiment, but I can see how it would be easy to think that based on what I had said. That's my bad, I'm sorry. To clear it up a bit this was not a decision made to spite anyone, and the choice to not do it again was made before moving forward with the H&B event. That was something that came about more recently. The last thing I want to happen here is any sort of mudslinging or w/e. I don't think that benefits anyone.<br><br>

                You're right that H&B doesn't have the space for that size of event and I must stress this again, that is not the kind of event we want or have the capacity to host in a way that we can comfortably oversee. While I trust requiem to handle their own business, I do not personally have the manpower to be present or even have someone present to oversee a week/month long event in a way that makes me comfortable with putting our name on it and calling it "official". I personally can't even go to these events because I am a disabled person with limited mobility and overall poor health.<br><br>

                Here is an example of what I mean. During last years event a sort of street fair happened at the same time. I did not know about this, and it sort of seemed like it was a surprise to the Requiem folks as well. From what I later understood it was something planned by the city and unavoidable. A large mobile tattoo parlor was parked in front of the cafe, and to their credit Requiem made the best of a poorly planned situation and tried to incorporate it into the event.. but if I'm being honest I really wish they hadn't or had at least asked me or anyone about it. I was not told about this until I saw posts on social media that our "officially endorsed" event would be offering tattoos. There is no universe where I or anyone here would endorse that. While they did what they thought was the best they could, I was not even consulted about it, nor was it cleared with anyone at WP/HICU etc. This is not the kind of thing I want to find out because I'm in bed scrolling through my instagram algorithm. As you can imagine, this is the exact kind of thing we can't afford to be liable for, even if miraculously nothing went horribly wrong. They did what they had to do, but my point is that it never should have come to that because we are not equipped to deal with something like that going awry.<br><br>

                Something like this upcoming pop-up, might require more initial footwork and setup on our part to get rolling, sure. However, it is much easier to oversee because there is no (for lack of a better term) babysitting involved. I'm not comfortable outsourcing the responsibility of chaperoning a bunch of kids in cosplay for several hours a day for multiple days. In fact, I'm not even comfortable in-sourcing that. I am not a childcare professional. If anything went wrong who do you think would have been held accountable? There were a handful of things that happened that I only heard about after the fact, and its honestly a miracle nobody got too hurt. It's nothing juicy or gossip-worthy, I just don't think it needs to be drawn out and I don't have the energy to get into some huge thing about it all. Sorry.<br><br>

                The H&B event isn't a party, it isn't a concert or a panel with special guests- it is a cute bakery pop-up with themed macarons and some fun limited run collab merch. Yes, the scale is much much smaller, but it is also just a completely different kind of event. They do these sorts of pop-ups often and have a great track record. I have had friends who have gone to many of these for various fandoms and properties over the years. This is much more in-line with the kind of thing we wanted to do initially and is being handled and run by the members of the current team.<br><br>

                I hope that addresses your concerns in a way that is satisfying to you and other concerned parties. I know it must seem a bit vague to not get every juicy detail but I really don't want to get anymore into it or drag this out into some sort of back and forth or air out anyone's dirty laundry or whatever else this could devolve into. I am sort of pulling the "I am an exhausted old man" card.<br><br>

                For what it's worth I am sorry we are not doing the event again, and it sounds like you had a fun time when you went. I will shoulder the responsibility for this, and the people these decisions have upset. So.. I'd humbly ask that you guys don't blame the team or hate on the event they are working hard to make happen, yeah?</p>

We decided to end things on this big argument 2 years ago and to see it finally happen and people‚Äôs reactions to it is‚Ä¶ radical. We all had so many feelings about how to close the book on this, especially in a way that was interesting and loving and not a shunting undesirables off screen. It was a big hope with this upd8 that despite these version of the characters being lowkey almost traumatic for the readers during 2019, we‚Äôd leave Act 1 with people hoping to know what happens to them next.

Any cool environmental settings you got planned?<br><br>Haven, Floral, Miles: The two-coin choice system was inspired.  It fits John's statement of "maybe there's such a thing as too much freedom," yet by having a narrative choice in the matter that eventually ends up remeeting back into a temporal knot down the line, it seems to allow for characters to have even more freedom in individual choices.

                <p class="question author-lugiatamer23"><strong>Q:</strong> what do you have to say to the haters (aka what are your responses to some of the common criticisms of the most recent update [mostly things that have shown up on this sub] that i dont feel like parroting here)<br><br>also, do you believe there is someone who is supposed to be "in the right" during the big End of Act 1 argument? since, besides Karkat really, which is addressed in-comic, it seems everyone, including Vriska, probably had some problems in their actions from what I have seen people say. im mostly on the fence of trying to figure out if this is good or bad writing or not, as if the intention was that everyone was supposed to be a little in the wrong, i think it checks out, but otherwise im not really sure how to feel. honestly not knowing how to feel has been my response to this update in general. (besides the art being awesome that's not really a question)</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Criticism is necessary part of the story reader engagement, people are allowed to not agree with our choices as writers because they are choices not rock solid, visions of truth that come to us in visions. Honestly, I think what I‚Äôd love to see is how people would handle things differently if handed these same scenarios. When I disagreed with Homestuck as a fan, I did that a lot and it built my ability as a writer so much and it has a soft place in my heart to see love put into fanon like that.<br>As for whose ‚Äúright‚Äù I wanted to answer this question very genuinely and say that it was really important to us in the writer‚Äôs room that the argument in the last update felt real to the characters and their differing values (and consistent to the continuity of what has happened to them up until this point in the story). That meant flawed perspectives, lacking context or driven by trauma and emotion. Utilitywise, this is a convo less about whose right and whose wrong but instead bringing the characters into awareness about each other and just where they stand after avoiding all their differences for 20+ years.</p>
                <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> We are going to write the story we write, but it is important to be able to listen to your audience and make them feel heard. Sure, there is a bit of bad faith among the valid criticism but it actually just means a lot to me that anyone cares enough to have an opinion. If they didn‚Äôt care at all they would just leave.<br>Who‚Äôs in the right? Sollux. This shit sucks and it's not fun, so, he left.</p>

                <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> I think my favorite panels are anything with intense action in them because I can always get stylistically experimental with them, hehe. The Jake vs Jane update was a riot, anything with Hell Tier Vriska, and also the recent panel with all the adults in Guardian Mode lookin‚Äô down at John I‚Äôm real happy about!</p>
                <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> My favorite panels to make are stuff made for the Flash! In the comic, I liked how the Rose-covering-Harry-and-Vrissy‚Äôs-Eyes panel turned out!</p>
                <p class="answer author-haven"><strong>HAVEN:</strong> So many, The Home on page 592 almost killed me while I was working on it but it fills me with joy, literally any panel with Al, the Dirk and Terezi panels during the previous 4/13 update, the Jane‚Äôs severed head panel i got to finalize over a kim sketch (the really scary crazy one), and ‚ÄúKids: Escape from above." another awesome one I'm very proud of.</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> I haven‚Äôt been drawing panels as long as everyone else, but I fucking loved drawing Jake‚Äôs hopesplosion and winged stance in the flash, along with the Dead!Dave super close shot and Jade punching John. I was kicking my feet so much. Besides that, I loved boarding update 6, update 12 and this last update and watching them come to life.</p>
                <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> Something I stressed very early on in HSBCs production is that it is very purposeful when and how we see the characters in various modes, especially in Candy. In the latest update, when we get a command for John to ‚Äúbe present‚Äù we are seeing the small classic sprites that they had when they were children. When we switch to Vriska as the focus, the adults are relatively normal sized again. There is some switching around and the way character are portrayed kind of shifts here and there. Eventually we switch to back to John after the big punch and we see that he suddenly sees that everyone here is an adult, literally towering over him. Everyone has grown up but him. Kim really knocked it out of the park with this panel, and I feel like that's the high point in this whole act for me.</p>

                <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> The vrisual novel and [S] 8r8k we‚Äôre both deliberately planned as is! I think the only thing so far that expanded much more in scope than we expected was the [S] page where Vriska was getting absorbed into the Plot Point portal. We talked about it in a past artist commentary on the Patreon, but I think the writers initially just proposed it as a fancy gif. Though, during production, I proposed it needed some more oomph to really get the drama and mystery across and everyone agreed!</p>

It's been a year since the website launched, and https://beyondcanon.com/recap is still "Returning Soon" and https://beyondcanon.canny.io/ has not seen much progress, even for the typo revisions, which had initially been fixed rather quickly, but has slowed down in recent months.<br><br>I believe James mentioned in a newspost at some point that work on the website would slow down for a bit, perhaps to prepare for the Flash.

                <p class="answer author-kohi"><strong>KOHI:</strong> That about sums it up, yeah. Between the v(r)isual novel, [S] 8r8k, Homestuck.com, and early development of the Official Homestuck Collection -- all of which requiring a level of technical involvement -- minor bug fixes and typo revisions for the site have taken a temporary backseat, just as a matter of priority.

                <p class="question author-n3cromancybitch"><strong>Q:</strong> Hi team, great job on the recent updates, extremely excited for the June developments being hinted at from the end of act update. Just one central question: with the Nipah in Vriska hell and Kyrie Rose from the patreon, as well as Rose‚Äôs attempted suicide in 8r8k visually referencing Urasawa‚Äôs monster, homestuck seems to finally be becoming anime.<br>How has the process of selecting new pop cultural reference points to work into the language of the comic been going? Are there works that you would consider key touchstones for your approach to the comic in terms of influence? And have Homestuck and Umineko secretly been the same thing all along?</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> TBF I haven‚Äôt seen The Monster anime yet, only read the manga so I can‚Äôt say that my contribution is making Homestuck anime. But I would say with referencing things, we focus on things that are really important to us and not just passing fancy or currently relevant. EX. I wanted to reference Monster because I felt like the nihilism of Johan would add so much context to the Rose‚Äôs own suicide. But also Monster as a whole has really influenced me along with all of Satoshi Kon‚Äôs work.</p>

                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> The writers start by all getting together and trying to roughly outline basic plot beats, then refining that outline down to ‚Äúupdate by update‚Äù chunks. Then, when it comes time to write a given update, we currently all get together and write it together in call! Floral is a fantastic boarder so we tend to sort of write and board simultaneously, then comes finished dialogue/narrative passes, and then we see which artists want to do which panels, or if a given artist wants to take a whole update for the final panels! Lots of input and collaboration happens between writers and artists on all steps, though. We try, and fail, but really try, to lock things in early, but every now and then one of us looks at what we‚Äôve got and realizes we have a tweak we just HAVE to make. Nothing bad ever happens because of this.</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> As for art, we‚Äôve been playing with different workflows recently but ones the thumbnails are done by the writers, and a color script has been made, we push the update along to the assigned artist, and we‚Äôll do art jams as a team if there is any visual development in need of ‚Ä¶. developing.</p>

                <p class="question author-reasonable_clue4648"><strong>Q:</strong> Hello. First time sending questions to an AMA ever, so apologies if I don't understand site etiquette.<br><br>1: For any of the writers/artists, is there any character that you dislike working on? And not because you dislike the character or anything, its just annoying getting them exactly right. (If the answer involves someone we haven't seen yet, yk feel free to ignore this).<br><br>2: For the writers, HS can be absurd a good majority of the time, and that's part of the humor. So I have to ask how do you balance that absurdity/humor out, personally? Like what is your mindset to make sure that neither you nor the audience overindulge in either end of zaniness/melodrama, and just get numb to it? When do you pump the brakes?<br><br>3: For anyone, is there anything you would've done differently with act 1 now that you can look back at it? Like if you had the dream of infinite money, infinite time, and the world wasn't constantly on fire/on the brink of catching fire, would you have changed something?<br><br>Thank you for reading, even if you don't answer; have a good day/night.</p>
                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Welcome to AMA‚Äôs! Thank you for joining us :J 1: I think the character I dislike writing the most is John, honestly, because I feel like I have to think the hardest about getting his weird-ass mindstate exactly right. He‚Äôs a bit less intuitive for me than a lot of the other characters, and feels a bit more informed by the scenes he shows up in than driven by a Really Strong Voice in the way that other characters are. Still fun, but I‚Äôll admit he‚Äôs tough! 2: For the humor balance, it‚Äôs really trial and error. We know the dramatic beats well in advance, but humor often emerges when we‚Äôre actually writing the final pass/script versions of the updates, and it often just comes down to: how good is the joke, and is there enough space for the drama to shine on its own if we include it? We do a lot of readthroughs of the updates in call to get a sense of the momentum of the scene, and it‚Äôs usually during those that it becomes clear if a joke is Too Much or hurts the scene more than it helps it. Luckily, though, Homestuck juggles comedy and tragedy pretty frenetically, so we have a lot of wiggle room! 3: To be honest, nah? I love what we did with Act 1. Maybe if we could have just gotten all the Hell-tier VN updates out faster so it wasn‚Äôt like two solid months of it, but I love what we did for it anyway so it‚Äôs not too much a thorn in my side.</p>
                <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> I don‚Äôt know why, but Aradia is always so tricky for me to draw‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs got such a specific vibe to her expression and attitude, and I find I keep challenging myself to get it right. Her schrodinger‚Äôs horn shape in the base comic don‚Äôt help either LOL.</p>
                <p class="answer author-andi"><strong>ANDI:</strong> Not particularly. I‚Äôm trying to think of which character took the LONGEST for me to get right, but I‚Äôm otherwise okay with drawing. I think it‚Äôd be Dirk. I remember the scene where BGD took off his glasses, I was seriously going through several forms of torture trying to get his eyes to look right on a face that has NEVER had even so much as an implication of the eye. Everyone else has been pretty straightforward for me. My main struggles are more technicalities, rather than character designs.</p>
                <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I think AlCal was the hardest for me to draw, even though I did a whole update for her. I just never drew that much of her before HS:BC!</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> 1. Honestly even if I don‚Äôt have strong opinions on a character, once I get to writing them I usually end up loving them. As for characters, I only don‚Äôt like boring characters and thankfully Homestuck is pretty good about not having those. 2. Honestly I think the biggest strength of us as writer‚Äôs is that we aren‚Äôt afraid of ridiculous ideas, but are committed and critical about justifying them. I love stupid and insane but it can‚Äôt be try hard or random. 3. If we had INFINITE money, probably make the flash a little bit longer. But besides that, everything is amazing, and everyone has really taken every part of Act 1 and exceeded my expectations with it.</p>

                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Nope. We all felt pretty excited to take what the epilogues gave us and see it through. The fun thing about the epilogues is with it‚Äôs unreliable narrators, we had so much to explore and chances to frame things in these awesome transformative ways! It‚Äôs like a big puzzle.</p>

I imagine there's a lot of plates spinning behind the scenes, but is it constant roundtable discussions/revisions? Do people have spheres that they're in charge of? Just meme spamming in Slack?<br><br>Also, what kind of future merch is on the table?

                <p class="question author-monkeyboyinc"><strong>Q:</strong> Throughout Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff's original run, I think you have to agree that there is a certain continuity to the art. Old elements are used and reused, time and time again, in ways that they really should not be used. These elements get exaggerated over time, with errors that arose due to distortions being incorporated into the art style. The path from from <a href="https://i.imgur.com/662V3KM.png">this</a> to <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vPjrEB4.png">this</a> to <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VWSkWvS.png">this</a> is traceable and makes sense, albeit in its own twisted way.<br><br>However, the upcoming Quest for the Missing Spoon book seems to have a brand new art style, one which has super-deformed proportions from the very start if <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NqokAHc.png">this</a> is anything to go by. With this seeming reboot to the art's continuity, do you feel you've earned the right to start out this shit with this new style? And furthermore, will this new style undergo an evolution throughout the book akin to the one that the original comic went through? Thanks.</p>
                <p class="answer author-dril_verifed"><strong>DRIL:</strong> i believe ive earned lots of rights as a marinecorps army vet, and also as a gamer, and that includes the right to obliterate the artistic continuity oif a web comic if it pleases me to do so</p>

BACK was cus I wanted to collaborate on an actiony cow-boy story with more fantasy settings. Ideas about them fly around and as I work on them both, I find the right ones to use and build this bridge.</p>

Andrew Hussie mentioned editing some of the pages, but I'm not sure what this means in practice.</p>
                <p class="answer author-kcgreenn"><strong>KC GREEN:</strong> Yeah, Hussie has the only power to "Deeped Frie" the images as per everyone's usual desire. But we are telling a narrative too. one that you can actually follow. so i guess there needs to be some leeway and compromise.</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> It is not correct to say that SBAHJ comics must always look like the worst possible garbage. In truth there is an acceptable range. Some pages can look kind of ok, others will look like they've been deep fried to hell and back. If you make it a rule that everything must be deep fried to the max then suddenly you lose the ability to appreciate some of the exceptionally putrid looking material. If everything looks like shit, nothing does. I went through and applied just the right amount of jpeg loss and artifact scum to every page, as needed. Some pages have a light touch, others are complete abominations.</p>

I've learned to let it go if I get stuck wondering if something will land or if I like another joke more over another. cus it will just lead me no where, personally.

In my spare time, I'm developing a D&D campaign for my friends, and one of the core factions of that world is the Midnight Crew. In it, they are a mafia-like structure of interplanar criminals. The Midnight Crew's name did not originate from any song, nor was it a reference to anything, I only thought it sounded cool.<br><br>

            Upon seeing that Andrew Hussie is willing to illustrate any comic page for a small donation, I decide to submit my idea to him. I did so under the username Mayonaka, which is simply Midnight in Japanese. What I gave Andrew was by no means comprehensive, and many, many facets of the Midnight Crew characters themselves were purely his creation. It struck a cord with the community and soon other donors were paying to see more of the Midnight Crew.<br><br>

            Fast forward many years and we're deep into Homestuck. Due to the Midnight Crew's popularity in Problem Sleuth (I assume), Andrew decides to make them a major part of his next story. Perhaps unwisely, I decided to step back into the spotlight through the MSPA Forums (may they rest in peace). With the forum handle "Professor," my first adventure there was not The Felt, but actually a strange story titled Voices. It had nothing to do with MSPA, Homestuck, or the Midnight Crew, but gained some small attention. After a short time, I decided to come out as Mayonaka, both to the community and to Andrew, and started a new adventure based on his works.<br><br>

            The Felt was my take on the rival organization Andrew had created for the Midnight Crew, and also explored some of my ideas for where he could go with them. It is also something I regret, for reasons which should become clear by the end of this. Using my connection to the Midnight Crew's creation, I leveraged myself into a position of supposed "semi-canon." Andrew was very polite and helpful when I messaged him repeatedly during the process, as I was trying to ensure that my Felt comic lined up with his vision for the Homestuck world. In retrospect, I wish I had stuck with something new and non-derivative, as I imagine this had to have been a nuisance to Andrew; though he never came across to me as impatient at all.<br><br>

            In any case, the Felt comic gained a lot of readers and attention, but also controversy. Andrew was being very non-confrontational about the whole "semi-canon" thing. In fact, at my request, he actually put a pendant in one of the panels which was intended to be worn by Professor Mayonaka, a character invented for the Felt comic to be the Midnight Crew's equivalent to Lord English (named, of course, after my old username). Either way, because there wasn't a clear "answer from god" on whether my comic was part of the Homestuck canon or not, it became ground zero for a small war within the forums. Realizing my mistake, I set fire to it. The Felt is gone, you can scarcely find fragments of it if you look hard enough. I didn't keep a copy.<br><br>

            In any case, here's our original email correspondence during the donations as proof. Ask me anything.<br><br>

              <p class="question author-moreepicthanyou747"><strong>Q:</strong> Dude, you're the stuff of legend around here. Well, you're the stuff of obscure, arcane Huss-tory trivia, but given that this is MSPA we're talking about here that might as well be legend. Thanks for showing up here.<br><br>Do you ever think you had a personal impact on Hussie withdrawing from his fans, or is that more the responsibility of the Act 5 fandom explosion that happened later than your Felt adventure?<br><br>Did you ever keep up with Homestuck afterwards? If so, what did you think about the direction the story took in the second half of the comic, especially the ending? If not, would you ever want to read the rest of it, and where exactly did you quit?<br><br>Have you done any more creative projects you think are worth sharing? You're clearly a pretty creative person-- even if you didn't have much input on the Midnight Crew, your Felt adventure is remembered well for a reason.</p>
              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> I certainly hope not. I doubt it. Andrew has always been nothing but kind to me in our interactions. If I had to guess, the fandom probably just got too big for one guy.<br><br>I did read Homestuck through to completion. I liked it well enough, but it got a little complex and hard to follow for me personally.<br><br>I've done some art for a small indie game company called Perfect Square Studios, you can find a few of their games on Steam.</p>

I've seen so many people talk about the pendant now that it's practically legend in my relatively newcomer eyes.</p>
              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> The comic eventually grew too complex for me to follow toward the end, but I am very excited for Andrew's game.<br><br>And the Felt were already in the comic before I started mine. My &quot;Felt&quot; comic was based on, and basically a prequel to, Andrew's sequence in which the Midnight Crew infiltrated their mansion.</p>

              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> With the MSPA forums gone, that's very difficult to answer with exact dates. What I can tell you is that it started shortly after the conclusion of Andrew's first Midnight Crew &quot;intermission&quot; in which they fought their way through the Felt's mansion, and that it came to an end a few months after that.</p>

              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> I didn't request it, but I think it was probably a reference to the discussions Andrew and I had had about Professor Mayonaka. He was intended to be composed of a sort of inky, black, ooze-like material; the product of experiments he'd conducted on other Dersites and himself.</p>
