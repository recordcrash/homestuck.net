                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-cynicalpsionic"><strong>Q:</strong> I've found that one of the biggest hanging questions of the original ending, which some of the old patreon updates touched on, is how this new world was put together.<br><br>I understand that this is a story about kids and their kids now, but Earth C is... Well, The Earth. And apparently it was segmented into four kingdoms? Where are those kingdoms? How have they run for 5,000 years while the kids skipped ahead?<br><br>Jane is Not-President in one world, but is actually president in the other? Is that of the whole world? What's the actual power structure and geography at work?<br><br>Put simply: Is there a desire to dig into the worldbuilding of Earth-C in both timelines, to explain how it all functions as a society, beyond the patreon update that effectively said &quot;Automated Socialism, but no longer&quot;?</p><p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> I think that a lot of how we want to explore this is in the way that the omega kids talk to each other.  I'm hoping to have them pepper a lot of references to the society they came from into their dialogue so as to let us allude passively (and occasionally actively) to that world.<p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Miles said it best, there is definitely thoughts and discussions we've had about Earth C but one of the things I love about Homestuck is how it feeds this information to you in really natural ways.</p>

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-herodeltiempo"><strong>Q:</strong> I know the team gets a lot of questions along the lines of &quot;how are you going to improve story X&quot; or &quot;can you please fix Y?&quot; and by now is probably sick of hearing them. But I, and likely dozens of other fans, want to know something much more important to Homestuck: What are some of the things the team is excited about making WORSE?</p><p class="answer author-hsbc_crew"><strong>ANDI:</strong> grins evilly</p>

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-fearshatter"><strong>Q:</strong> James: What pushed you and the others into picking this project back up?<br><br>
                  Kim: Are you intending to push for new artstyles that mirror the spirit of Homestuck but defy the usual conventions (as you guys have so far) similar to how Hussie continued to try and innovate new styles for various moments?<br><br>Andi, Chumi, Haven, and Floral: Who's your favorite character to draw, and do you have a favorite godtier outfit you're looking forward to drawing?  And/or a favorite moment?<br><br>Haven, Floral, and Miles: Who are your favorite characters to write, and how do you feel about your grasp on them?  Are you looking forward to growing the universe and seeing where it goes and how you can further defy narrative conventions and embody the spirit of HS in your own way?<br><br>
                  Kohi: How is it working on the web treating you?  Are you looking forward to the possibility (slight, but not out of the question) of breaking a site again like Hussie did by working together on this project?  Further, what sites do you wish you could advertise HS^2 on if you could?  Alongside this, what kinds of difficulties do you have to deal with maintaining the servers and site?</p>
                  <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> I think the easy answer is we just really love Homestuck, also Andrew asked me specifically to do it. I handpicked this team because I thought they truly understood what made Homestuck good. Wow they are typing so much in this google doc. I'm watching the words fill out like little ants.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> Absolutely! I've been thinking a lot about this actually! Homestuck is such a living piece of work that's constantly evolving, including the artwork as well. I love that while so far we have been drawing in a way that is very reminiscent of Andrew Hussie's early Homestuck art, I really wanted to emphasize to all the artists that we should also strike a balance taking a lot of our own artistic liberties and just go crazy with it illustratively. No spoilers, but there's a certain part of the story we DEFINITELY want to go wild and experimental with it LOL.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> My favorite character to draw is Jade!!! Harley!!! hehe. ‚úåÔ∏è Other than the obvious answer, probably Aradia! And a favorite GTier outfit.... I'd say Vrissy's! Take that as you will, hehe.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-andi"><strong>ANDI:</strong> I really like drawing Aradia, I love drawing big hair. She's very fun!! I don't like a lot of god tier outfits lol. But when I do draw them, you know I'm gonna go incredibly hard..
                <br></p>
                  <p class="answer author-haven"><strong>HAVEN:</strong> my favorite characters to draw in fanart are dave, karkat, vriska and aradia but since starting working on the comic panel-wise my favorite characters to draw are The Alternate Calliope and kanaya. I'm looking forward to drawing vriska's god tier more.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Personally, I really gravitate towards Space players along with John. They really lean into my wheelhouse with how subtle their voices are. Not to mention I love ‚Äú""nice""" characters because their motivations require a lot of nuance. I also love writing Karkat because he's closest to my own sense of humor. <br>I am so so excited to work with the universe of Homestuck. I love the themes of OG HS so much and I love discussing what it means to make a story. *rubbing my hands together*<br>As for the art question, I love drawing Jade, Kanaya and Karkat 8). Jade is one of my fave godtier outfits too.
                <br></p>
                  <p class="answer author-haven"><strong>HAVEN:</strong> honestly it's kind of a cop out answer but i really love writing literally every character, this is all a dream come true. I find myself enjoying every character more as i get chances to write them, recently The Alternate Calliope in particular has been really fun for me.
                <br></p>
                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> I love writing almost anyone, but I think one of my surprise new passions has been writing Dirk, who hasn't shown up much at all in the comic yet, but (spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!) will.  Everyone is fun, though.  I think one of my best strengths as a writer is character voice, to say nothing of the fact that I'm one of the millions of us who has a Homestuck Lobe of my brain.<br>Where the story/universe is concerned, I am more excited than you could possibly fucking imagine.  We have some really, really incredible stuff coming both insofar as we're continuing the plot we inherited and jumping into new stuff.  It's a huge honor, folks on the team can tell you that I'm constantly geeked about it.
                <br></p>
                  <p class="answer author-kohi"><strong>KOHI:</strong> Working on the site has been pretty rewarding! As far as breaking the site goes, obviously that's something that no web developer wants to see happen, but the Homestuck fandom takes it in stride and finds it more amusing than detrimental. With site maintenance difficulties, the biggest challenges are  making sure to respond to any alerts that pop up for our VPSes, as well as any new CVEs that pop up. Y'know, typical routine routine webdev stuff.</p>

                  <p class="answer author-andi"><strong>ANDI:</strong> But really, if its gonna happen, we need to make homestuck even bigger than the peak of 2014. If we can do it once, we can do it again, yall have crashed websites before. C'mon. Don't you wanna see that limited edition god tier john skin hit the griddy? Could you imagine a vrillyhoo pickaxe?</p>
                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> You guys are literally our only hope of this.  Please don't let us down.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> demand homestuck in fortnite anyway heres what im thinking for the first drop. Typically fortnite collab drops come in threes. Obviously John has to be one, but we have to have at least one troll. I'd say Terezi, because she has the most alt outfits. Backbling would be a perfectly generic object or Casey. The emote would be a traversal Ghost Pogo Ride</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-johnvantas"><strong>Q:</strong> Hi James. Can we expect interactive (Flash) pages in the near future? I do understand it's not as easy as it sounds but I'm still curious.</p><p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> ‚ÄúNEAR?" future? How about this. We have at least one planned. I'm committing everyone to it by saying this.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-suspiciousmrguy"><strong>Q:</strong> Many of you have been involved in homestuck fanworks in the past (and continuing into the present.) How different does it feel, working on HSBC? Does it feel basically the same as working on fanworks, or does the level of &quot;official-ness&quot; make it feel different for you? How much of a dividing line do you draw there, mentally? I'm interested in all of y'alls personal perspectives on this!</p>
                  <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I would say it's quite different! The ‚Äúofficialness" is something that's a little intimidating for me, knowing that this thing I've drawn will be seen by many, MANY people and forever regarded as canon. It does affect how I tackle each storyboard and panel. Of course it's still very exciting though! Being part of Homestuck is a dream come true, and I want to convey how much I love our stuff and Homestuck through my work! I'd say I'm learning a lot! üòÄ</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> It's definitely different making something as a fan vs making something officially LOL. I think what's important to consider is that since a wider audience is involved, you have to take into account that a lot of story decisions are now very crucial. Especially if there's anything I know from being a fan of Homestuck of 10+ years, we as fans LOVE to theorize on all the little details‚Äì so we gotta be very intentional too! I'm very much the kind of person who loves to play in the realm of non-canon, so I very much compartmentalize what I'd like to keep for myself as a fan to play with VS. what we make canon.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kohi"><strong>KOHI:</strong> There are a lot of similarities that carry over between any kind of collaborative work like this, but the fun has been seeing the different workflows and processes that the members of the team have brought with them. This is a craft where you're always improving yourself and those working with you through these nuances. The ‚Äúofficial-ness" brings with it an inherent weight of responsibility, sure, but I think we'd be giving our best work regardless.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Personally, with my fanwork projects that process is definitely a bit different and I actively try to approach it differently too. With the Liminal Space comics, the mentality is to interact with the source material in a format and subject style that is contradictory. It's all about the inbetweens and the quiet moments of Homestuck canon. Fanwork feels like a suggestion for other readers to try out a new perspective. The fun of official work is separating from that and working with the larger team about what feels right and true. It's not about ‚Äúlook at this fun thought I had" but moreso how I would approach original work. ‚ÄúThis is a functioning, finely tuned narrative that people will be interacting with as source material." It's really fun this switch up and I love working on Homestuck with other people. Fa work is isolating honestly(at least how ive always done it)  but now we can all celebrate and be excited together.</p>

Looking at our plans for the plot structure right now I can't imagine it's going to take us less than three years of regular updates, but it could end up stretching longer.  You're going to be happy for that, trust me.  I'm gonna be saying this a lot, but we have So Much Neat Shit to get through. </p>

It's a story that hit me HARD when I started reading back in 2010 and was my whole life for a while.  It remains one of my favorite stories ever, so getting to continue it and put some of myself back into it is a dream come true and feels very full-circle for me.  Like, I get to write this now?

The possibilities are honestly limitless within this universe, and I just love to create within it and that's what constantly keeps me invested and coming back as a creative. I think I'm honestly chasing the high of how creatively inspired the fandom was back in 2014, and it'd be so cool if we can continue to reach that audience of people who feel that creativity.</p>

                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> I also first read it in 2011 when I kept seeing this Karkat guy showing up everywhere in my DeviantART feed and I needed to know who these gray motherfuckers were. I'm honestly pretty consistent with my interests, even when my interest would have waned for a couple years, I always had a foot in the door for the fandom.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> I mentioned this earlier but I started reading in 2010.  I caught up right before Bec Noir happened and that whole era leading into and including murderstuck was one of the best times to be an active reader in the entire life of the comic, at least in my experience.  I knew I was obsessed at the time, but I think it'd still surprise young me how long I'd care.  If I could travel back in time and tell myself I'd be writing the sequel I think young me would like... shit himself.  </p>

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-yuei2"><strong>Q:</strong> How big do you think relationships will play into this? I think romantic relationships have always gotten a lot of love in the comic, but due to the nature of comic parental/authority and kid relationships were very barely present. <br><br>Something that makes HS:BC unique to me especially comparing it while re-reading the original is that all all adults existing alongside their children + the mid-20 something's version of of the adults to on the other side.<br><br>Should we expect more of the same distance when taken to relationships between adult and children as HS? Or can we look forward to like adults and children working together having developed relationships between two people not a child and vague authority figure?<br><br>Also does anyone on your staff like/love Alt-Calliope? <br><br>She is low key one of my favorite characters and I feel both her and Calliope were dreadfully under utilized. Alt-Calliope being malicious and yet ‚Äúgood" and having it out with Jade is low key one of my favorite post-comic moments.</p><p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> We definitely are gonna be ruminating pretty heavily on the parent-child relationships, and as you pointed out the adults this time are Full Characters who are themselves going to be having their own arcs and adventures, but these groups (the kids vs the adults) are going to merge and subsequently distance themselves from each other pretty often and chaotically over the course of the narrative.  A lot of these intergenerational relationships are things that the individual characters might need to work through themselves.  Homestuck gives a lot of responsibility to people to work their own shit out, then converge and sort of... emotionally compare notes.  Also, we fucking love Alt-Calliope, and I get the feeling that after we're done you're gonna love her even more.  </p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> What fun about Homestuck is that despite the game actively putting distance between children and their guardians, the guardians are always present in how the kids approach playing the game. Especially with the 4 betas. And personally that's one of the things I love about it. Also Alternate Calliope fucking rules.</p>

A really interesting observation about the ‚ÄúHomestuck art style" is that... it has always been visually all over the place, and that's what makes it fun! It's daring! It's experimental! Of course, there's lots of recurring stylistic ticks, but there's no singular art style‚Äì if that makes sense. I think all the artists on the team have a mutual understanding where we wanna go with it visually too, but the most important thing we all have to remember‚Äì you gotta have fun with it!!!</p>

If not, will that be replaced by &quot;acts&quot; or something else? How should the story's parts be referred to, for example should we call the first 15 Chapters Homestuck^2, and everything onwards Homestuck: Beyond Canon?<br><br>Any plans on adding an adventure map for HSBC?</p><p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> We've been internally thinking of HSBC in Acts, and we're probably gonna crystallize that going forward.  For reference, everything that's happened in HS^2/HSBC up til now would be considered to be part of HSBC Act 1.  I believe we'll be delineating these things pretty clearly In-Comic, so over time/in retrospect it's gonna be pretty clear.  You'll know when an Act has ended, and when a new one is beginning.  As for what you should call the first chapters, I think you can sort of unofficially call those chapters ‚ÄúHS^2" if you want to refer specifically to that as a production era, but Homestuck: Beyond Canon is gonna be the name of the whole story, and HS^2 is the first part of That Story.</p>

                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Meetings and meetings and meetings and meetings.

Though, of course, the writing team spearheads it and have their own pipeline process LOL. When it comes to the art, it's a whole back and forth process with the artists making their boards and sketches for the update. I would constantly correspond with the artists, as I help overlook and make sure all the boards read clearly and unifies the overall visual intention for the comic.</p>

A few questions if that's okay :)<br><br>1) What's the internal thoughts on the younger skew of the fanbase, especially when most of the content within the comic and Beyond Canon comic itself is geared towards older and adult readers? Will it continue being for older readers, or will it be a bit more sanitized/for all ages? I'd prefer to have it more adult still personally, but that's for you guys to decide ultimately .<br><br>2) Are there any updates on a gacha-type game you've discussed a few times, just as an idea? Or any other merch plans you can share?<br><br>3) Thank you for being nice to Roxy. Not a question ig.</p><p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I think our main priority is writing a story that's loyal to our vision. Since it so happens that HS:BC is currently exploring a lot of ‚Äúadult" themes, HS:BC so far has been more adult-oriented. Of course, as the course of the story progresses, this is subject to change just as the themes of the story change! We're working on merch ideas, but that'll probably come at a later date, since we're more focused on settling in right now. Gacha game, we think about it all the time, at every meeting.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> For your first question, Chumi put it best, I think we're simply focused on just trying to tell a good story. I don't think ‚Äúsanitizing it" is our goal or the right way to put it either, but we just want to tell our story honestly, ykwim? And sometimes, those topics may touch upon more mature themes!</p>
                  <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> The thing about young people is that they just keep making new ones. Audiences are always gonna skew ‚Äúyoung" and thats cool man. I read things that were meant for older audiences as a kid, and theres very little we can do to stop kids from reading it. I think the best we can do is make it clear this intended for an older audience and cater it to that intended audience.<br><br>As far as a gacha game we half-joke about it.

I know Hussie has largely washed his hands of HS (in a creative capacity, anyway), and we'll almost certainly never see a complete collection of HS books, but do you know if there's any possibility that we'll see a continuation of his author's notes in any form? I totally understand if he just wants to move on from talking about HS/making HS content himself, but I would love to see them on the Patreon or as a paid-for plug-in for the unofficial collection, or something else like that.<br><br>2. Is there any chance we ever get to see any of Homestuck's story bibles/development documents? Every time James mentions the classpect one, my Hunger grows. I know James always wanted to make a SBURBology-style guidebook, which would essentially be those sorts of documents turned into an actual product. Now that James directs the HICU, might SBURBology finally see the light of day?<br><br>3. On a related note, what's everyone on the team's dream HS merch? Besides SBRUBology, I would personally kill for Nendoroids of all my little blorbos.<br><br>4. What's everyone on the team's dream HS-related project?

I don't want to get too into stuff just yet without working some stuff out on the back-end, but we'd very much like to see the author's notes continued and are actively looking into avenues to explore that.  We'd love to have some good news for you guys on this front early next year, but no promises.  As for question 5, I love writing Tavvy.

What's hardest I'd say is distancing yourself from what popular fan readings say and finding your own voice. Except I also love that.

It's actually been enormously helpful for me in terms of seeing how developed my understanding of these characters is and testing where it makes sense for us to take them.  As for who to give the aux I was gonna answer Dave, originally, but I don't know that this is a safe thing to do.  I'm changing my answer to Equius, because you know he's listening to a bunch of heavy shit.  Cybergoth industrial.  Hardstyle.  Dubstep.  Prog metal.  Headbanger shit.  </p>

                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> We get to balance both.

                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> Before the hiatus, I definitely feel like the art was a lot more standardized‚Äì which isn't a bad thing, per se! There's a convenience to having the art very streamlined, but of course that would mean there's a limitation to what we can do as artists. I've always admired the experimental aspect of Homestuck's art, and I hope we can re-introduce that within Beyond Canon again!</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Personally I love the challenge of writing with pre-establish styles. The main draw of being in fandom is the interaction between the author's original vision and then working within those parameters while being true to myself. Respect to source material is paramount imo. And considering a core part of Homestuck's charm is reveling in authentic author voices and the constant push to break convention, the very format of Homestuck requires embracing new frontiers.

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-jenoice"><strong>Q:</strong> could the team share some of their backgrounds on previous works before joining the homestuck?</p><p class="answer author-andi"><strong>ANDI:</strong> lots of us has tons of stuff under our belt! I was just a little commission artist doin some freelance here and there. Then I got invited to do some sprites on Pesterquest, and then HS2 artwork. And now I'm here on HS:BC! </p>
                  <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I've been doing freelance art for maybe a decade and convention tabling for awhile as well! I've also worked on multiple HS-related projects, canon (HS Cafe, Act 6 Tarot Deck on FFBF when it still existed), non-canon (zines), and fan-adventure related. This experience also expands to non-HS projects! I just like getting involved in projects, so I've done LOTS of random stuff here and there.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> I've done storyboards and board revisions for HBO Max, and have worked on several indie productions (mostly for games) doing a variety of things like character designs, illustration, and animation! I was brought on-board working on Homestuck since I was in college, so there's also just a lot of Homestuck in my professional resume too LMFAO.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> When I was in my early 20's I used to work in a country club as a manual laborer, basically just picking up heavy things and moving them from one place to another. I was a music teacher for a while. I worked in insurance briefly but hated it. I've been doing music for webtoons and stuff under various names since I was in my teens. I worked as a sound mixer on Steven Universe: Future, and have done a lot of music for pitches and pilots etc. I wrote on Pesterquest and Hiveswap a little. I've done a lot of things behind the scenes as well but thats not as exciting.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> I have my fancomic project Liminal Space and have been in an array of fanzines like the Phantasmic Youngsters. Outside of Homestuck, I've done Original Character Tournaments and 1 silly try at a webcomic in my early 20's. I've worked so much food service to pay for school.</p>

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-wide_juice_3285"><strong>Q:</strong> Follow up question! If that's ok ;-; <br><br>Is there any chance for John to get his mustache back? My opinion is that his design would look much better with it and it's so painful to read that he had it and shaved it off before we could see it! And on a related note, are there any plans for the kids to start resembling the guardians more?</p><p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Jake 'stache-mogged him.  It's kind of devastating.  I think trying to come back from that would be an arrogance even John is incapable of.  It's like, you're both sort of sadsacks but one of you is a thick muscle hunk and the other one is his schlubbier look-a-like, you don't wanna add salt to the wound of that comparison by growing a weaker mustache.  I feel you, though.  Facial hair is a good look.  Underutilized.</p>

                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> I can tell you who's NOT cool.  I saw Dirk at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you're doing now?" I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?" but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?" and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Orange Fantas in his hands without paying.<br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first." At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.<br>When she took one of the bottles and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence," and then turned around and winked at me. I don't even think that's a word. After she scanned each bottle and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</p>

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-redbitser"><strong>Q:</strong> We should probably refrain from asking story questions but I have to know: Is June Egbert still (assuming it was planned back then) happening?</p><p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> I'm going to be honest with you guys, June was always the plan. The ‚ÄúToblerone Wish" just happened to line up with what was already going to happen. So Andrew ‚ÄúConfirmed" it. This is true of a lot of homestuck stuff, actually.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> From what I know, June has definitely always been planned since the beginning even within the prior team, and her transition is technically a spoiler that Andrew revealed early on and, while we understand the hype (I'm hype too!), but we gotta let it cook within the story!</p>
