              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> What came first, the songs or the flashes? or did the artists planned them both at the same time?, and what was the case with cascade?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> The songs always came first. They we're almost never composed with a particular animation in mind. They all existed in reserve then I would pick one for an animation I had in mind, or sometimes a song would just give me ideas for an animation. Only a few were arranged for an animation coming up, Cascade being one of those which is probably obvious because nobody was making 15 minute songs back then. It's just a few preexisting songs that got stitched together and reworked a little based on directions I had, because I knew the general sequence of things. There were only a couple other examples like this, the end of Act 6 and Act 7. All other animations I used existing songs for and arranged the animation entirely around the timing of songs, and often let the stuff happening in the song shape ideas for what was going on in the animation, like a sort of "audio-storyboarding". All of the music was extremely influential on the way the content took shape and you could say even dramatically shifted the narrative sometimes.</p>

              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> For this new  gen of readers who are inspired or moved by Homestuck and are creating their own things, some for the first time in their life, do you have any words of encouragement, advice or otherwise for them?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Well first I would say don't try to make something like Homestuck yet, it's too ambitious and complex, which isn't to say you can't shoot for something like that some day, but it's better to start much smaller and try to get some finished works in your collection. Leaving things unfinished is something that plagues aspiring creators and can lead to a lot of self doubt. So controlling scope to be manageable is a good idea for a while. This isn't to say you can't draw inspiration from what Homestuck did. If you look around the fandom you'll see countless fanworks that Homestuck inspired, many in the "MSPA" format, which is exactly what you see HS doing. Each page has a panel, as many words underneath as you like including none, and a casual style of advancing the story where pretty much anything goes. Any mixed-media experiment, any unconventional storytelling ideas you have, any blend of humor and seriousness, for as long as you want. It's a great format for exploring your creative boundaries, and many creators have started with fanworks like this and gone on to do more impressive things later.</p>

              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> Curious what you think of our spec characters?(especially Ballsweat Horsecock)</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> I haven't seen Ballsweat Horsecock yet, I think the server staff might be keeping them from me, concerned that if I saw them I might get a little worked up and cause an incident. They would be right about this. As always their judgment needs to be trusted implicitly and everyone needs to be doing their part to make sure my containment field isn't breached.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="qa-pair">
              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> How has the development process of Homestuck been for you, and how challenging was it to maintain such a regular cadence of release for so long with the series?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> On paper, Homestuck lasted for 7 years, 2009-16. Zooming in a little, there was a period of virtually uninterrupted work for about 4.5 years, at which point there was the "gigapause" which was a year long gap. Those 4.5 years really were nonstop work, with the only gaps being ones which preceded drops like Cascade, which needed a 6 week pause while I worked on it constantly until it was done. I wouldn't even say this lifestyle was challenging because it's just what life was back then. If it tried to be two things, work insanity + normal life, that would be challenging, but by eliminating the second thing it was possible. The first 4.5 years really was an "all day every day" thing. Weekends and holidays were indistinguishable from other work days, and work days included nothing but work, which was interrupted only by sleep, often only briefly. Once you reinvent yourself to be something like that, the extreme labors don't even really feel that difficult anymore, just normal. But just because this is possible doesn't make it a good idea, and I don't really recommend anyone attempt such a thing. If you spread it out to a more sane pace of work, realistically Homestuck was something like a 20 year project, or maybe longer. We are only at year 16 since it started, so it still wouldn't be done at that rate. So it's almost worth asking, would a story like Homestuck be worth making if it took 2 or 3 decades to finish? I'm inclined not to think so, and that's about how I felt back then, which is why there was so much intensity put into it forcing it into a relatively small window of time. It also helps explain why over this span I became obsessed with methods of creative efficiency as they relate to visual storytelling.<br><br>Everything you see in HS is an expression of this efficiency, or an exploration of it. The question at all times was, how do I maximize the engagement time of the reader while minimizing the labor time needed to secure that engagement? For aspiring creators I feel this is one of the most valuable things it has to offer, a sort of guide by example on how to economize your creative decisions to the fullest extent while still drawing strong reactions from readers.</p>

              <div class="qa-pair">
              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> What has it been like seeing this year's resurgence in the homestuck fandom?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> I think it's good to see, and no matter what anyone may say about the fandom and the less flattering side of its reputation, you can always count on moments where the fandom shows its true nature, which I've long felt was primarily characterized by passion for creativity. A thing I've had to make certain adjustments for is that popular properties literally never die. There's always going to be some level of interest keeping it alive, and then interest picks up again, new adaptations are proposed, pilots get made, and the cycle just continues, probably forever. As long as I'm around I'll probably keep getting pulled back into its gravitational well, because as the creator necessarily so many of these new developments revolve around me and what I have to say. Either I can say "hey don't talk to me about this" or I can remain somewhat engaged. The first option doesn't quite work, because it communicates something false, which is the impression that I see no value in the work or what it accomplished, or hold no appreciation for those with good intentions who keep its spirit alive. I value both of these aspects of its legacy, so it seems only reasonable to make room in my remaining lifespan to offer a certain amount of guidance over its continuing evolution.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="qa-pair">
              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> How long did it take to make it?<br><br>If you could change one thing up to Cascade, what would it be?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> If you mean how long did Cascade take to make, about 6 weeks. Previous to that the next longest time it took to make something was Descend which I think was only about a week. There really wasn't much reason for Cascade to go as hard as it did, something less probably would have sufficed. It was just another installment in what I viewed as an "extreme creator" arc where the goal was always to outdo myself, and also outdo myself by substantial margins nobody was expecting. At the time it wasn't really the type of thing anybody thought was going to drop, and before that, Descend wasn't either, and so on. The problem with such escalation is at some point it hits the maximum of what is possible within short timeframes and Cascade was probably that, which unavoidably means what follows represents an exploration of ideas like recession, rebooting, revisitation, deconstruction, and other extremely cool meta-narrative themes which everyone definitely loves. These are ideas, for better or worse, which carry the story through Act 6.<br><br>As for what I would change leading up to Cascade, I personally wouldn't change anything, but other people might have answers to this, such as readers maybe, and Homestuck characters definitely.</p>

              <div class="qa-pair">
              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> Are there any characters you you wish you had handled better in Act 5? Do you wish you had given any of the killed trolls more moments before they died?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> I know I'm probably supposed to be avoiding spoilers with newgen questions, and I'm not sure if this is really a spoiler, but nobody is ever even that dead after death in Homestuck. If you feel a character was mishandled before death, have some patience, you'll see there are so many new and inventive ways for me to mishandle characters by bringing them back to life.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="qa-pair">
              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> Why is it called "homestuck" anyway? They aren't stuck in their homes for very long at all</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Maybe if they leave their houses so soon after the story begins, and the story is called "Homestuck", then we can surmise their physical houses were never their true homes in the first place. And maybe, if we want to make even less sense, we can further deduce that their true homes were the metaphorical houses they got stuck in along the way.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="qa-pair">
              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think about specstuck/the newgen fandesigns for the kids/trolls, do you have any favorites?<br><br>Is there anything you wanted to include in homestuck so far but couldn't for whatever reason?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> I like all the newgen fan designs, and with all respect to the oldgens, they're better than any speculative designs I ever saw back in 2009. But fandom culture was totally different back then, you really couldn't expect such explosions of fan art and speculative creativity. Greater fandom culture radically changed during Homestuck's run to resemble what people now take for granted today, and I don't think I'm being too indulgent by saying Homestuck's run actually did a lot to shape modern fandom culture. It feels pretty crazy saying this, like I'm on some unc shit, trying to tell kids that back in the day fandom wasn't like this, and it's only like this now because I started posting way too hard for 7 years. But that really does seem to be what happened. I was there, I saw it happening, and for this I will forever owe the world the debt self-exile, which I stubbornly refuse to pay.<br><br>I can't think of much I wanted to put into Homestuck but didn't, but can think of a bunch of things I didn't want to put in, but did, and a bunch of things I did want to put in, did put in, but shouldn't have. Suffice to say the number of things which got put into Homestuck vastly exceeds the number of things which didn't, which explains why Homestuck just keeps on happening. There are just so many fucking things left to cram into Homestuck, whether I or anyone else wants them there or not.</p>

              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> Were there any characters you expected to be more or less popular than they ended up being?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> I expected Fedora Freak to be a runaway sensation, but he sadly got very little attention. Recent events have corrected this grave cosmic travesty. Also little known fact, Homestuck was going to be a one page gag showing a kid named Zoosmell and then quickly cut over to Fedora Freak and watch him fold laundry for hundreds of pages, but fan reception to the first page was so overwhelming, I had to pull a crazy story out of my ass just to make the fans happy.</p>

              <div class="qa-pair">
              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> Have any of our theories so far been right? You dont have to say which ones but the knowledge we're on the right track would be crazy [editor note: this is a fan who's still reading the comic]</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> I haven't paid close attention to the newgen theories, but I keep hearing of bits and pieces which are on the right track, which is a lot more than can be said about the oldgens who were reading live at the time. People never guessed anything right back then. Although sometimes someone would speculate something so outlandishly weird or dumb I would find a way to incorporate the idea into the lore, or at least reference it in some way. I'm not sure if newgen readers are more media savvy than the old ones, or maybe they've been exposed to spoilers ambiently and are subconsciously calling shots better, or maybe they all just came from the Undertale and Deltarune fandoms where those games channel the same kind of energy because Toby himself trained his worldbuilding instincts by imbibing heavily from my specific brand of idiot juice. So deductions by Homestuck logic which wouldn't make sense to normal people make perfect sense to them. This sounds like a pretty good theory right? See, fans can have fan theories about creators, and creators can have creator theories about fans.</p>

              <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> what was your method of making sure shit still made sense even with such a complex and large scale project as homestuck?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Oh trust me it makes no sense whatsoever. However I deployed many cunning tricks and gambits which made you think it does. And when you really think about it, isn't that a lot more impressive than making something which makes sense? Making sense is easy. Making the senseless assume mysteriously coherent forms which demonstrate an unnerving degree of self awareness so as to haunt the dreams of millions as well as its own creator, now that's hard to pull off. It also turns out the inclination to do such a thing makes even less sense than the story itself.</p>

                <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> As of Psycholonials and interviews at that time you seemed to have been really unhappy with the effects of fandom in general, not just the Homestuck fandom. Is that less true now?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> In a way it's unfortunate to share opinions via interviews, or maybe at all, because it can amount to revealing an infinitesimal sliver of one's experiential totality, turning the mole hills of passing rumination into imaginary mountains of conviction and absolute certainty. There are ideas we share with others as one might handle a fidget toy, which then get mistaken for a pair of handcuffs. Works of art and statements made will populate the psychological profile of a cerebral apparition which happens to share the name of an author, and then some day that author may be asked to answer for the condition of somebody's private ghost. This can get a little awkward. There are millions of ghosts who share my name and I speak for not a single one. But I've also long since retired the practice of trying to train my phantasmal doppelgangers to do a better impression of me. As it turns out these ectosynaptic holograms comprise a fearsome legion far less governable than fandom itself.</p>

                <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> Did you ever think you'd have to make the Beforan ancestors or did you always assume it wouldn't be relevant enough to even do?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> It never crossed my mind for a moment that they would ever be made, and I gave exactly zero seconds worth of thought to them before The People willed them into existence. Even the Beforans in the story were never meant to be shown originally, but The People similarly forced the issue back then, but through a less orderly process.

                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Since I don't release much, people probably get the impression I'm not doing much, but that isn't the case. The stockpile of concepts and works in progress is always pretty steep. In a way, Homestuck is the smaller visible part of an iceberg representing stuff I made, which includes a greater unseen volume of drafts in varying states of completion. The size of unreleased things, not measured by wordcounts or visuals, but lore, character counts, summaries, sketches, and other conceptual metrics, greatly exceeds the scale of Homestuck. I haven't been in a big rush to get any of this finished and visible to people for several reasons. There's a lot of "been there done that" with Homestuck, marking turf I'd rather not retread, and high on that list is speeding through production at the expense of... just about anything at this point. There's also the lurking concern in the back of my mind that releasing another work of any substantiality may amount to arming another doomsday device in the form of Fandom Two. But the gravity of this metaphor may mischaracterize how I feel about the perils of fandom, which I don't actually think is a body that difficult to commune agreeably with or pacify if so desired, and doesn't take an excessive amount of effort, however, it does take SOME effort. And any non-zero value for effort represents something which needs a time budget, and there are only so many hours in a week that can be applied to making and publishing New Thing, while tending to Fandom One so as to keep the peace, and while cultivating Fandom Two so as to avoid pioneering new kinds of war. When you consider how difficult creation alone is, even without adding the labor of juggling multiple fandoms, then you might understand why I wouldn't be in such a hurry to deploy new works...<br><br>This isn't to say I won't, and maybe that day isn't even too far off, but until then it's been occupying a fair amount of bandwidth taming whirlwinds once reaped from from sowing all this god damn wind. - John Egbert probably</p>

                <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> Hi Andrew! How aware were you of the toxicity of the relationship between Dave and Bro while you were writing the early acts? Did you write it as unrealistic cartoon shit and then matured deeper thoughts on it when writing Act 6 or were you pretty aware of the realistic nature of the relationship from the beginning?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> I was aware of it, but the beginning of the story wasn't the time for any meaningful examination of what that meant, because it was being perceived through the eyes of a younger Dave in denial about what was going on. That denial is expressed to the reader through the fraught relationship's abstracted or cartoonish presentation, where abuse came across more like a form of slapstick, and given no further depth. The story couldn't communicate the seriousness of that situation until Dave himself understood it, because that's how these topics reveal themselves to the reader - through character arcs. What the story has to say about topics such as this is shown, not told, and the "showing" happens when the characters tell us how they feel about them.</p>

                <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> what was beforus's first guardian?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Much like the Beforan ancestors, this is another topic I never gave any thought to, as it would be difficult to name a sum of money that I could be paid to care about Beforan lore. It turns out the only force on earth that can get me to care even remotely about Beforus is the POWER OF DEMOCRACY. After The People spoke, at that point the only difficulty I had in drafting new Beforan lore was having to constantly wipe the tears from my eyes.<br><br>I don't have an answer to this, but I do have the same thing you all have, which is an array of puzzle pieces to think about. We know it can't be Doc, because he's the host for Lord English, and his job is to bring him into the universe by arranging its future destruction somehow. He only showed up in a scratched version of the troll universe, and his name also happens to be Scratch, which of course is a pool term as well as the term used for rebooting a universe. I don't think this was stated or implied anywhere, but in this sense it would be fitting if Doc only showed up in scratched universes, which means the pre-scratched versions of those universes would be cosmically designated for being scratched, to let Doc show up, so English could show up too.<br><br>So what guardian should Beforus have to signify this designation, as if flagging the universe for a post-scratch appearance of Doc?<br><br>What else do we have to work with? We have our pre-scratch universe, where earth has an omnipotent dog guardian, and post-scratch, suddenly it's a cat. Is this just unremarkable parallelism on my part, or does it point to a sort of rule, and what would that rule be?<br><br>Dogs have adversarial relationships with cats, and getting more specific, dogs are the aggressors toward cats. So what can we do with this? Doc, like the cat, is a post-scratch guardian, and he's just a talking cue ball. Do cueballs have natural enemies or aggressors? I can only think of one, and it's a stupid answer. A cue stick.<br><br>But on second thought, maybe this isn't so bad. Everything about Beforus is pretty lame in comparison to Alternia. Why wouldn't they have a first guardian that's an "omnipotent" cue stick that just sits there for millions of years doing nothing? It doesn't have a brain, so it can't meddle with civilization, so Beforus turned out that way. Remember it was said to be Doc's intervention that messed up troll culture and turned it more violent. But what can a cue stick do? Jack shit is what.<br><br>Something else about this which makes sense is it reminds me of how a virus works. A virus sometimes is a small stick-like object which only carries some pernicious DNA. It isn't sentient and has no real motor functions. It infects a host, then problems come later. The cue stick doesn't do anything, but discovering one on your planet should be like a cursed warning sign that your universe is fucked, but not even this version. The scratched version to come later is. This leads us to wonder if any of the Beforans encountered this cue stick and what they might have done with it. Did it make the rounds through the known cast? Did it make its way into the hands of the Draconian Dignitary? We know he likes to swing those around.<br><br>Is this good lore? Do we feel smarter or dumber for learning all problems in Homestuck trace back to a magic cue stick on an irrelevant planet full of shitty lore the author didn't care about? For that matter, did you even need me to figure this out? The pieces were right there staring you in the face all along.</p>

                <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> Hi Andrew! Love your work and have been a fan for the majority of my life now (Problem Sleuth era). There's a few things I'd like to ask.<br><br>Have you ever read "The Tempest" by Shakespeare? The most obvious connection to Homestuck is the name "Caliban" and Caliborn, but because of this superficial connection I've noticed a lot of things during Act 6 that could unintentionally be inspired by the events and narrative of the play / novel. Was wondering how many of these or even if any of these connections were intentional.</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> No, it actually traces to an old name for King Arthur's sword which was Caliburn, which itself is an iteration on an older Welsh term, Caledfwlch, which was the name of the legendary piece of shit sword Dave broke. As for why Caliborn's name would be linked to this Arthurian lore involves diving into what these symbols meant in the context of the story and there are two problems with that. Doing that is probably going too far with this Q&amp;A and also I may be coming dangerously close to forgetting some of these details. The good news is, if we give it just a little more time, I will probably have completely forgotten most of it, then we will finally be out of the woods and can stop wondering about it entirely.</p>

                <p class="question author-rando"><strong>Q:</strong> i still continue to be genuinely astounded at how many seemingly small details become super important later on, especially now that the newgens are making these amazingly unreal connections. were there any of these unplanned small details in the start of homestuck that unintentionally became important later on?</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> It's hard to say that this ever "unintentionally" happened because the whole point of littering the story with small details, like many objects and interests in their bedrooms, was to create a substantial inventory of unassuming details which had the potential to come back and be consequential later. I knew this was going to happen, because in the previous comic, Problem Sleuth, it was happening organically all the time. Like some candy corn he stored in his hat the whole time was used as a weapon at the end. So while making a followup story that was more complex and ambitious, I thought, ok, this is going to be happening a lot, so I'm going to give myself hundreds of 'candy corn' examples to work with later in whatever way turns out to be interesting.</p>

                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> From my perspective I haven't been anywhere. As in, I'm not missing to myself, because that makes no sense. If you mean I was missing to the internet, I don't know where the internet is. It's not a place. There are various platforms I guess. I don't stream or blog or anything. Am I supposed to? You probably wouldn't even be hearing from me lately if not for this recently established server, and so I would still be "missing". It's hard to call someone gone if there's no such thing as here, and whenever you ask anyone what here means, they say something like "I dunno... it's just that you've barely spent any time in Torso Chewer lately... not even to speak of the Bone Harvester :(" People who aren't presently submitting themselves to such contraptions probably shouldn't be labeled as missing, and nobody ever got put on a milk carton because they were a no-show at a dick punching party.</p>

                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> A lot of people have asked about the fabled document containing lore about classes. There really isn't much to that document, it's about one page, and mostly focuses on scale of passive to active, the pairings, and just a little extra that probably isn't worth sharing unless it's retouched and expanded on more formally.<br><br>For now, these are the pairings, which are staggered a bit in probably an unpredictable way. Lord and muse are the extremes, but aside from that, there's some weird stuff going on. The maid/heir pair are both fully on the passive side, and witch/sylph are fully on the active side. All the others are split between active and passive, but the gap begins to narrow as you progress.<br><br>Why? Because it's more fucked up that way, and it maximizes the blast radius when vaporizing countless volumes of fanon conjecture.<br><br><img class="img img-fluid" src="classpects_active_passive_dichotomy.png" alt="Classpects active passive diagram"></p>

                i'm here today operating as a member of Hiveswap's...

I've got one more before I leave y'all in peace: This project's been a long, LONG passion project, and is now gettting a seat at the table during what a lot of folk are calling Homestuck's Second Renaissance. All this being said IS Hiveswap considered an official HICU project or its own standalone thing with its team? Will the team stick around and work on anything else once it's done? Do these distinctions particularly matter to y'all?</p>
                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> It is a standalone project, my presence and Kims is just us being on this team in our own capacity it is in NO WAY a HICU project and it's very important to emphasize this.

              <p class="question author-thood74"><strong>Q:</strong> It's good to see Homestuck stuff in general be more transparent. A lot of the time in the past it felt very opaque and inscrutable, quite understandably so but still<br><br>I'm glad everythings a lot more civil and optimistic now</p>
                <p class="answer author-vibri"><strong>VIBRI:</strong> **honestly** , homestuck at the creative level has always been indie, even though there was a period when it was owned by a corpo who strongarmed control, the stuff happening at the lower level like the game/comics/continuations is all passionate hardworking people who just want to make things happen, and there was a point where the tensions of the community made things so so hard to interact with publicly, most of the team is (not to speak for them, just saying from what ive seen,) honestly pretty scarred over the last few years of atmosphere ... yaknow. so. a lot of silence has been out of anxiety and borderline necessity by people who just ... want to make shit. and . not be harassed. so. thats why were putting a lot of emphasis on community building and trying to foster a safer and more positive environment so that our teams feel comfortable and safe interacting again, rather than just "dropping it when its ready." and putting their heads back down to work. i cant say whether or not it was a GOOD idea, just, what happened naturally. so thats why we are trying something new and trying more honest transparency and interactivity and community building and nurturing..we want to give u guys what u want... just as much as u want it... lol</p>
                <p class="question author-tmohs"><strong>Q:</strong> It's really unfortunate that the minute someone starts creating things (for you to enjoy!) a lot of people seem to stop viewing them as human lowkey. Hopefully fostering a sense of community here will make people happier and chill out and make the team feel safer and more comfortable and able to be involved in what they want to be involved in.</p>
                <p class="answer author-vibri"><strong>VIBRI:</strong> this is the goal, i have all my fingers and toes crossed &lt;3<br>if things keep going in the direction they have been, then, well... lets just saaaayyy... expect some(plural) new hussie-original stories :)</p>

                <p class="answer author-vibri"><strong>VIBRI:</strong> honestly a bit of emphasis on "doing your part" should be made at some point by someone other than me (doing wishful thinking) but if people want a safer community it starts at the micro level, community members can do a lot to move the mountains and we can in turn as staff keep giving ppl what they want</p>

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-cynicalpsionic"><strong>Q:</strong> I've found that one of the biggest hanging questions of the original ending, which some of the old patreon updates touched on, is how this new world was put together.<br><br>I understand that this is a story about kids and their kids now, but Earth C is... Well, The Earth. And apparently it was segmented into four kingdoms? Where are those kingdoms? How have they run for 5,000 years while the kids skipped ahead?<br><br>Jane is Not-President in one world, but is actually president in the other? Is that of the whole world? What's the actual power structure and geography at work?<br><br>Put simply: Is there a desire to dig into the worldbuilding of Earth-C in both timelines, to explain how it all functions as a society, beyond the patreon update that effectively said "Automated Socialism, but no longer"?</p><p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> I think that a lot of how we want to explore this is in the way that the omega kids talk to each other.  I'm hoping to have them pepper a lot of references to the society they came from into their dialogue so as to let us allude passively (and occasionally actively) to that world.<p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Miles said it best, there is definitely thoughts and discussions we've had about Earth C but one of the things I love about Homestuck is how it feeds this information to you in really natural ways.</p>

                  Kim: Are you intending to push for new artstyles that mirror the spirit of Homestuck but defy the usual conventions (as you guys have so far) similar to how Hussie continued to try and innovate new styles for various moments?<br><br>Andi, Chumi, Haven, and Floral: Who's your favorite character to draw, and do you have a favorite godtier outfit you're looking forward to drawing?  And/or a favorite moment?<br><br>Haven, Floral, and Miles: Who are your favorite characters to write, and how do you feel about your grasp on them?  Are you looking forward to growing the universe and seeing where it goes and how you can further defy narrative conventions and embody the spirit of HS in your own way?<br><br>
                  Kohi: How is it working on the web treating you?  Are you looking forward to the possibility (slight, but not out of the question) of breaking a site again like Hussie did by working together on this project?  Further, what sites do you wish you could advertise HS^2 on if you could?  Alongside this, what kinds of difficulties do you have to deal with maintaining the servers and site?</p>
                  <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> I think the easy answer is we just really love Homestuck, also Andrew asked me specifically to do it. I handpicked this team because I thought they truly understood what made Homestuck good. Wow they are typing so much in this google doc. I'm watching the words fill out like little ants.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> Absolutely! I've been thinking a lot about this actually! Homestuck is such a living piece of work that's constantly evolving, including the artwork as well. I love that while so far we have been drawing in a way that is very reminiscent of Andrew Hussie's early Homestuck art, I really wanted to emphasize to all the artists that we should also strike a balance taking a lot of our own artistic liberties and just go crazy with it illustratively. No spoilers, but there's a certain part of the story we DEFINITELY want to go wild and experimental with it LOL.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> My favorite character to draw is Jade!!! Harley!!! hehe. ✌️ Other than the obvious answer, probably Aradia! And a favorite GTier outfit.... I'd say Vrissy's! Take that as you will, hehe.</p>

                  <p class="answer author-haven"><strong>HAVEN:</strong> my favorite characters to draw in fanart are dave, karkat, vriska and aradia but since starting working on the comic panel-wise my favorite characters to draw are The Alternate Calliope and kanaya. I'm looking forward to drawing vriska's god tier more.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Personally, I really gravitate towards Space players along with John. They really lean into my wheelhouse with how subtle their voices are. Not to mention I love “""nice""" characters because their motivations require a lot of nuance. I also love writing Karkat because he's closest to my own sense of humor. <br>I am so so excited to work with the universe of Homestuck. I love the themes of OG HS so much and I love discussing what it means to make a story. *rubbing my hands together*<br>As for the art question, I love drawing Jade, Kanaya and Karkat 8). Jade is one of my fave godtier outfits too.

Everyone is fun, though.  I think one of my best strengths as a writer is character voice, to say nothing of the fact that I'm one of the millions of us who has a Homestuck Lobe of my brain.<br>Where the story/universe is concerned, I am more excited than you could possibly fucking imagine.  We have some really, really incredible stuff coming both insofar as we're continuing the plot we inherited and jumping into new stuff.  It's a huge honor, folks on the team can tell you that I'm constantly geeked about it.

As far as breaking the site goes, obviously that's something that no web developer wants to see happen, but the Homestuck fandom takes it in stride and finds it more amusing than detrimental. With site maintenance difficulties, the biggest challenges are  making sure to respond to any alerts that pop up for our VPSes, as well as any new CVEs that pop up. Y'know, typical routine routine webdev stuff.</p>

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-suspiciousmrguy"><strong>Q:</strong> Many of you have been involved in homestuck fanworks in the past (and continuing into the present.) How different does it feel, working on HSBC? Does it feel basically the same as working on fanworks, or does the level of "official-ness" make it feel different for you? How much of a dividing line do you draw there, mentally? I'm interested in all of y'alls personal perspectives on this!</p>
                  <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I would say it's quite different! The “officialness" is something that's a little intimidating for me, knowing that this thing I've drawn will be seen by many, MANY people and forever regarded as canon. It does affect how I tackle each storyboard and panel. Of course it's still very exciting though! Being part of Homestuck is a dream come true, and I want to convey how much I love our stuff and Homestuck through my work! I'd say I'm learning a lot! 😀</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> It's definitely different making something as a fan vs making something officially LOL. I think what's important to consider is that since a wider audience is involved, you have to take into account that a lot of story decisions are now very crucial. Especially if there's anything I know from being a fan of Homestuck of 10+ years, we as fans LOVE to theorize on all the little details– so we gotta be very intentional too! I'm very much the kind of person who loves to play in the realm of non-canon, so I very much compartmentalize what I'd like to keep for myself as a fan to play with VS. what we make canon.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kohi"><strong>KOHI:</strong> There are a lot of similarities that carry over between any kind of collaborative work like this, but the fun has been seeing the different workflows and processes that the members of the team have brought with them. This is a craft where you're always improving yourself and those working with you through these nuances. The “official-ness" brings with it an inherent weight of responsibility, sure, but I think we'd be giving our best work regardless.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Personally, with my fanwork projects that process is definitely a bit different and I actively try to approach it differently too. With the Liminal Space comics, the mentality is to interact with the source material in a format and subject style that is contradictory. It's all about the inbetweens and the quiet moments of Homestuck canon. Fanwork feels like a suggestion for other readers to try out a new perspective. The fun of official work is separating from that and working with the larger team about what feels right and true. It's not about “look at this fun thought I had" but moreso how I would approach original work. “This is a functioning, finely tuned narrative that people will be interacting with as source material." It's really fun this switch up and I love working on Homestuck with other people. Fa work is isolating honestly(at least how ive always done it)  but now we can all celebrate and be excited together.</p>

If I could travel back in time and tell myself I'd be writing the sequel I think young me would like... shit himself.  </p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> I first read Homestuck in 2012 but the hyperfixation wasn't real yet. I dropped it for quite a few years, in the beginning of Act 6. But then I reread around the end with Collide. I drew Dave taking a snapchat of President Karkat and it was over after that. I don't think there will ever be a time in my life I don't think about Jade Harley.</p>

                <div class="qa-pair"><p class="question author-yuei2"><strong>Q:</strong> How big do you think relationships will play into this? I think romantic relationships have always gotten a lot of love in the comic, but due to the nature of comic parental/authority and kid relationships were very barely present. <br><br>Something that makes HS:BC unique to me especially comparing it while re-reading the original is that all all adults existing alongside their children + the mid-20 something's version of of the adults to on the other side.<br><br>Should we expect more of the same distance when taken to relationships between adult and children as HS? Or can we look forward to like adults and children working together having developed relationships between two people not a child and vague authority figure?<br><br>Also does anyone on your staff like/love Alt-Calliope? <br><br>She is low key one of my favorite characters and I feel both her and Calliope were dreadfully under utilized. Alt-Calliope being malicious and yet “good" and having it out with Jade is low key one of my favorite post-comic moments.</p><p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> We definitely are gonna be ruminating pretty heavily on the parent-child relationships, and as you pointed out the adults this time are Full Characters who are themselves going to be having their own arcs and adventures, but these groups (the kids vs the adults) are going to merge and subsequently distance themselves from each other pretty often and chaotically over the course of the narrative.  A lot of these intergenerational relationships are things that the individual characters might need to work through themselves.  Homestuck gives a lot of responsibility to people to work their own shit out, then converge and sort of... emotionally compare notes.  Also, we fucking love Alt-Calliope, and I get the feeling that after we're done you're gonna love her even more.  </p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> What fun about Homestuck is that despite the game actively putting distance between children and their guardians, the guardians are always present in how the kids approach playing the game. Especially with the 4 betas. And personally that's one of the things I love about it. Also Alternate Calliope fucking rules.</p>

A really interesting observation about the “Homestuck art style" is that... it has always been visually all over the place, and that's what makes it fun! It's daring! It's experimental! Of course, there's lots of recurring stylistic ticks, but there's no singular art style– if that makes sense. I think all the artists on the team have a mutual understanding where we wanna go with it visually too, but the most important thing we all have to remember– you gotta have fun with it!!!</p>

For reference, everything that's happened in HS^2/HSBC up til now would be considered to be part of HSBC Act 1.  I believe we'll be delineating these things pretty clearly In-Comic, so over time/in retrospect it's gonna be pretty clear.  You'll know when an Act has ended, and when a new one is beginning.  As for what you should call the first chapters, I think you can sort of unofficially call those chapters “HS^2" if you want to refer specifically to that as a production era, but Homestuck: Beyond Canon is gonna be the name of the whole story, and HS^2 is the first part of That Story.</p>

I'd prefer to have it more adult still personally, but that's for you guys to decide ultimately .<br><br>2) Are there any updates on a gacha-type game you've discussed a few times, just as an idea? Or any other merch plans you can share?<br><br>3) Thank you for being nice to Roxy. Not a question ig.</p><p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I think our main priority is writing a story that's loyal to our vision. Since it so happens that HS:BC is currently exploring a lot of “adult" themes, HS:BC so far has been more adult-oriented. Of course, as the course of the story progresses, this is subject to change just as the themes of the story change! We're working on merch ideas, but that'll probably come at a later date, since we're more focused on settling in right now. Gacha game, we think about it all the time, at every meeting.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> For your first question, Chumi put it best, I think we're simply focused on just trying to tell a good story. I don't think “sanitizing it" is our goal or the right way to put it either, but we just want to tell our story honestly, ykwim? And sometimes, those topics may touch upon more mature themes!</p>
                  <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> The thing about young people is that they just keep making new ones. Audiences are always gonna skew “young" and thats cool man. I read things that were meant for older audiences as a kid, and theres very little we can do to stop kids from reading it. I think the best we can do is make it clear this intended for an older audience and cater it to that intended audience.<br><br>As far as a gacha game we half-joke about it.

                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Agreed, Act 5 is the most crystallized in my mind when I think about the Homestuck Highs.

PS, I'm excited to see y'all's work!</p><p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> Depending what you mean by “affiliation," but we do have a couple overlapping team members with the Hiveswap production (including me), but so far we have been working independently from the Hiveswap team. In regards to spin-offs/other Homestuck projects, I think we answered it pretty succinctly <a href="#gacha-question">here!</a></p>

                  <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> New frontier baby!!! Of course we want things to be at least a little familiar and connected to the OG Comic and HS2, but I think we're blazing our own paths here. It's really exciting, I hope you all will stick around to see what we do! If I could tell you guys, I would (NOT because it's more exciting to wait and see).</p>
                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> We get to balance both.  As writers on a story that is at times viciously meta, I think it's important to be faithful to the style we inherited for the sake of like... already established Universal Integrity, but I actually really enjoy working within that style and adding my own flourishes to it.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> Before the hiatus, I definitely feel like the art was a lot more standardized– which isn't a bad thing, per se! There's a convenience to having the art very streamlined, but of course that would mean there's a limitation to what we can do as artists. I've always admired the experimental aspect of Homestuck's art, and I hope we can re-introduce that within Beyond Canon again!</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Personally I love the challenge of writing with pre-establish styles. The main draw of being in fandom is the interaction between the author's original vision and then working within those parameters while being true to myself. Respect to source material is paramount imo. And considering a core part of Homestuck's charm is reveling in authentic author voices and the constant push to break convention, the very format of Homestuck requires embracing new frontiers. So we stay winning no matter what.</p>

I was just a little commission artist doin some freelance here and there. Then I got invited to do some sprites on Pesterquest, and then HS2 artwork. And now I'm here on HS:BC! </p>
                  <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I've been doing freelance art for maybe a decade and convention tabling for awhile as well! I've also worked on multiple HS-related projects, canon (HS Cafe, Act 6 Tarot Deck on FFBF when it still existed), non-canon (zines), and fan-adventure related. This experience also expands to non-HS projects! I just like getting involved in projects, so I've done LOTS of random stuff here and there.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> I've done storyboards and board revisions for HBO Max, and have worked on several indie productions (mostly for games) doing a variety of things like character designs, illustration, and animation! I was brought on-board working on Homestuck since I was in college, so there's also just a lot of Homestuck in my professional resume too LMFAO.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> When I was in my early 20's I used to work in a country club as a manual laborer, basically just picking up heavy things and moving them from one place to another. I was a music teacher for a while. I worked in insurance briefly but hated it. I've been doing music for webtoons and stuff under various names since I was in my teens. I worked as a sound mixer on Steven Universe: Future, and have done a lot of music for pitches and pilots etc. I wrote on Pesterquest and Hiveswap a little. I've done a lot of things behind the scenes as well but thats not as exciting.</p>
                  <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> I have my fancomic project Liminal Space and have been in an array of fanzines like the Phantasmic Youngsters. Outside of Homestuck, I've done Original Character Tournaments and 1 silly try at a webcomic in my early 20's. I've worked so much food service to pay for school.</p>

And on a related note, are there any plans for the kids to start resembling the guardians more?</p><p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Jake 'stache-mogged him.  It's kind of devastating.  I think trying to come back from that would be an arrogance even John is incapable of.  It's like, you're both sort of sadsacks but one of you is a thick muscle hunk and the other one is his schlubbier look-a-like, you don't wanna add salt to the wound of that comparison by growing a weaker mustache.  I feel you, though.  Facial hair is a good look.  Underutilized.</p>

                  <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> I can tell you who's NOT cool.  I saw Dirk at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you're doing now?" I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?" but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?" and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Orange Fantas in his hands without paying.<br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first." At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.<br>When she took one of the bottles and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence," and then turned around and winked at me. I don't even think that's a word. After she scanned each bottle and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</p>

                  <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> From what I know, June has definitely always been planned since the beginning even within the prior team, and her transition is technically a spoiler that Andrew revealed early on and, while we understand the hype (I'm hype too!), but we gotta let it cook within the story!</p>

I can't believe how well ye've balanced homage to and continuity with OG and previous Homestucks with freshness, surprise and new personality in both art and writing.<br><br>My q: I became a dad since reading the previous incarnations of Homestuck, and it's been a total change in my worldview. I think about this in particular in connection with BC's focus shifting away from the OG characters towards the omega kids. I wonder if this story decision came from similar transformative experiences you guys have had, or if there have been any other transformative experiences you guys have or want to incorporate into the story. Thanks!</p>
                <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> Congratulations on becoming a dad!! What a life-changing event!! 😀 I would say that growing up in general has influenced how I interpret Candy specifically. I started reading Homestuck when I was like 12 and I'm 27 now, just as the kids started as 13 year olds and are now in mid-life in Candy. I am a different person now! Some changes were for the better, some for the worse. My favorite characters are different, older people now, and it's been so interesting to explore why and how it happened. I think HS:BC reflects parts of my own experience with growing up, becoming different, and reconciling with that. Additionally, as someone who is a “fandom figure(?)”, thinking about my self-perception versus how my audience perceives me. It's been slightly touched on with Jade, how it feels to be an eternal celebrity and how their image of her differs from her actual self. I have a lot of thoughts, but I'll leave it at this for now HEHE.</p>
                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Serious congrats on your new journey of fatherhood! I think, as Chumi mentioned above, that our own journeys through childhood and also through the growing up of Homestuck itself as a story and a fandom are absolutely huge influences on what we've done and where we hope to go with the rest of the story.</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> That's awesome, congratulations!!

                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Definitely. Jake is definitely a “safer” public figure to be obsessed with but Karkat is the kind of sexy countercultural hero that can't help but get a lot of play in Earth C society, notorious rogue that he is... we put a little tidbit in the last update about Jane having to spend a lot of time smearing him in the media because otherwise his rugged proletariat charisma would probably just run rampant through their society. I'm sure all the gods deal with this on some level, but Karkat sort of occupies a special echelon (a spechelon) where this is concerned by virtue of his controversial role in their current history. Sorry for spending a bunch of time writing about how Karkat's hot bod challenges society.

I had a conversation with Andrew about this recently and how Homestuck came into itself in an era that doesn't exist anymore. The way we interact with things online has fundamentally changed and evolved and in order to remain "relevant" homestuck, and the very nature of it being "a webcomic" would have to evolve as well. It is very easy to say things like this because I don't know what that would even mean. I'm not gonna be out there making homestuck dance tiktoks or doing like corporate social media viral engagement bait shit. that sucks and nobody wants that. but homestuck has always kind of been an experience that extends beyond the pages of a webcomic<br>anyway, i am interested in seeing how we evolve both as a property and a community.</p>

                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> From most to least crazy? Hmmm... Jane probably takes the cake here for outlandish, but I think Rose and John are dealing with more like... mind-alteringly intense existential problems, and are less Stable. Jade is being pushed pretty far emotionally by the hole she's dug herself into, but I think she's fundamentally got her shit together, she's just really upset. Kanaya is definitely angrier than Jade, but I think still able to hold herself together more. Roxy, by contrast, is less angry than Kanaya, but more... out of touch? I wouldn't say she's crazy but she's also deep in the cope-realm and still needs to absorb the reality of what's happening. Jake is seeing a lot more clearly recently than he has in a while, but I think the excitement of making all these new stressful steps probably has him feeling shaky. Callie is just vibing but again, priorities are a little mixed up. Karkat is probably who I'd consider to be near the most adjusted right now. Angry and tired and stressed out, but he's got a good head on his shoulders, he's thinking solution. Meenah is chilling, honestly. Shit's all worked out great for her. This got way too long.</p>

                <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> The original event was back during the VIZ days, and we didn't have much creative control over it. VIZ got paid a small percentage of overall sales that was not extended to WP, though some of us participated in a freelance capacity. We wanted to do something with a bit more creative control, but the second Requiem cafe event was already in motion before we could plan otherwise. We were more interested in doing something on a much smaller scale that would be easier to keep track of ourselves, and the Requiem events ballooned to be weeks long with very little oversight from anyone tied to Homestuck. We declined to do the event again back in October, and decided to move forward with another opportunity presented to us in H&B. They do much more focused pop-up events like this all the time, and it was more in line with what we wanted to do originally.</p>
                <p class="question author-lupocani"><strong>FOLLOWUP:</strong> Thanks for providing some insight on this. That said, the choice seems baffling and frustrating from the point of view of an attendee.<br><br>

                Requiem's 4/13 has been held twice. Both times it sold out, both times it was beloved by those who went. By a margin of six months or so, it's been an important thing for many homestucks for longer than Beyond Canon has. It's been the closest thing we might ever have to a "real" Homestuck convention, and it's not even that big — it hosts, what, just over a hundred people?<br><br>

                Wanting an event where you're more involved makes a degree of sense — but going out of your way to replace the only real physical Homestuck party with an even smaller one (and with an untested concept besides) seems incredibly strange. Does H&B even have the space and facilities for people to gather and talk like Requiem does? Will they be able to host performances? Especially when demand is as high as it is — if H&B is even smaller, surely both could sell out! That's what you'd want, when growing a fandom.<br><br>

                Perhaps there are more detailed reasons you haven't shared, but currently the situation just seems weird, almost like the more popular event has been sabotaged to make way for a more closely held one. Like Requiem, I wish H&B all the best for their party — but I'll miss the old one, and I sincerely hope you'll give them the chance to host again in the future.
                </p>
                <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> You know, that's fair. I recognize the Requiem event was special for a lot of people and to their credit they hosted a fun event in a space that could handle something like that.<br><br>

                I think "replace" is the wrong sentiment, but I can see how it would be easy to think that based on what I had said. That's my bad, I'm sorry. To clear it up a bit this was not a decision made to spite anyone, and the choice to not do it again was made before moving forward with the H&B event. That was something that came about more recently. The last thing I want to happen here is any sort of mudslinging or w/e. I don't think that benefits anyone.<br><br>

                You're right that H&B doesn't have the space for that size of event and I must stress this again, that is not the kind of event we want or have the capacity to host in a way that we can comfortably oversee. While I trust requiem to handle their own business, I do not personally have the manpower to be present or even have someone present to oversee a week/month long event in a way that makes me comfortable with putting our name on it and calling it "official". I personally can't even go to these events because I am a disabled person with limited mobility and overall poor health.<br><br>

                Here is an example of what I mean. During last years event a sort of street fair happened at the same time. I did not know about this, and it sort of seemed like it was a surprise to the Requiem folks as well. From what I later understood it was something planned by the city and unavoidable. A large mobile tattoo parlor was parked in front of the cafe, and to their credit Requiem made the best of a poorly planned situation and tried to incorporate it into the event.. but if I'm being honest I really wish they hadn't or had at least asked me or anyone about it. I was not told about this until I saw posts on social media that our "officially endorsed" event would be offering tattoos. There is no universe where I or anyone here would endorse that. While they did what they thought was the best they could, I was not even consulted about it, nor was it cleared with anyone at WP/HICU etc. This is not the kind of thing I want to find out because I'm in bed scrolling through my instagram algorithm. As you can imagine, this is the exact kind of thing we can't afford to be liable for, even if miraculously nothing went horribly wrong. They did what they had to do, but my point is that it never should have come to that because we are not equipped to deal with something like that going awry.<br><br>

                Something like this upcoming pop-up, might require more initial footwork and setup on our part to get rolling, sure. However, it is much easier to oversee because there is no (for lack of a better term) babysitting involved. I'm not comfortable outsourcing the responsibility of chaperoning a bunch of kids in cosplay for several hours a day for multiple days. In fact, I'm not even comfortable in-sourcing that. I am not a childcare professional. If anything went wrong who do you think would have been held accountable? There were a handful of things that happened that I only heard about after the fact, and its honestly a miracle nobody got too hurt. It's nothing juicy or gossip-worthy, I just don't think it needs to be drawn out and I don't have the energy to get into some huge thing about it all. Sorry.<br><br>

                The H&B event isn't a party, it isn't a concert or a panel with special guests- it is a cute bakery pop-up with themed macarons and some fun limited run collab merch. Yes, the scale is much much smaller, but it is also just a completely different kind of event. They do these sorts of pop-ups often and have a great track record. I have had friends who have gone to many of these for various fandoms and properties over the years. This is much more in-line with the kind of thing we wanted to do initially and is being handled and run by the members of the current team.<br><br>

                I hope that addresses your concerns in a way that is satisfying to you and other concerned parties. I know it must seem a bit vague to not get every juicy detail but I really don't want to get anymore into it or drag this out into some sort of back and forth or air out anyone's dirty laundry or whatever else this could devolve into. I am sort of pulling the "I am an exhausted old man" card.<br><br>

                For what it's worth I am sorry we are not doing the event again, and it sounds like you had a fun time when you went. I will shoulder the responsibility for this, and the people these decisions have upset. So.. I'd humbly ask that you guys don't blame the team or hate on the event they are working hard to make happen, yeah?</p>

There is a lot of confusion and mysticism about the old music stuff and who has the rights to what etc, so I'd want to do new contracts that favor the musicians a little more. I have been trying to get this set up (and get the old albums back up) but it is taking a sort of insane amount of time, due to a plethora of other little things that have priority. It feels like it could be so simple but for reasons beyond my ability to fathom it is not. For whatever reason the music stuff always seems to be the slowest moving cog in all this. Probably because there are just so many damn people to contact. It's a legal miasma.<br>I actually won't really be contributing much in that regard. I'd be more than happy to have anyone from the old team come back, but some new blood would be great too. I'd love suggestions. I'll set up a way to do that once I'm able.</p>

We all had so many feelings about how to close the book on this, especially in a way that was interesting and loving and not a shunting undesirables off screen. It was a big hope with this upd8 that despite these version of the characters being lowkey almost traumatic for the readers during 2019, we'd leave Act 1 with people hoping to know what happens to them next.

                <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> Deltritans. Full stop. Deltritus session. Anything to do with Aradia. I'm sad she doesn't have anything to do right now. I bring her up at every writers meeting. “How can we work Aradia into this?” then they all shoot me with guns. Wow this is a really involved question! I think working with people you trust is paramount to a project like this.</p>
                <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> I LOVE the direction we went with Vriska's Hell Tier design. She went through a lot of iterations (which we'll be getting into in one of our artist commentaries coming up soon), but what we ended up all feeling very strongly about is that she appeared more *abstract* and conceptual. She's surpassed being defined within the comic, and now as you all have witnessed from the recent update she's even breaking from the confines of it! AHHH SHE'S ESCAPING</p>
                <p class="answer author-andi"><strong>ANDI:</strong> The vriska hell tier design was one of our first art jams ever and it was incredibly fun to do. I'm looking forward to more sessions like that with this team.</p>
                <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I don't wanna make any promises with merchandise, but I have done a lot of reaching out in a bunch of different directions (some old, some new)! My personal preference for merch includes wearable items that are ~subtly~ fandom-presenting and collectibles like figures and plushies, but will it come true…? Crossing my fingers! As for future character designs and drawings, I am SO looking forward to showing off the Deltritans. I think they will be a big hit!!My favorite Omega changes every day, so I'll say Tavvy for now!</p>
                <p class="answer author-haven"><strong>HAVEN:</strong> 1.) Yes... I love designing new outfits so much...<br>2.) Yes<br>3.) My favorite Omega is Harry but I like them all a lot.</p>
                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Yes! And my favorite Omega kid is Tavvy; I'm soooo excited for us to serve up a little more of who he is, and where he's going to go. He's my brave little soldier… (Also, I know I wasn't technically asked this, but I'm also going to chime in and say I'm ALSO super, SUPER stoked for Deltritus.)</p>
                <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> My first contribution to Beyond Canon was being commissioned to draw Yiffy's design, so I have a little sentimental bias towards her LOL. But of the four Omega kids, I think Harry is also pretty up there as one of my favorites. As you can imagine we'll be spending some more time with these kids in this comic, we'll be learning more glimpses about their lives outside of their parents too!</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> We literally just have a few art jams to figure out new outfits that I am so so excited for but, there's so many we have been working on. I'm also a big environmental design person and what we've been cooking up for Deltritus… Delicious. Also i like the multiple choice question, it would be pretty cool if we did!! Lastly…. this is so hard to choose… but I think it may be Yiffy that is my fave Omega. I've thought A Lot about her interactions in the boarding school, her gang … how it built her into the punk she is today. Wrow.</p>

                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> When I joined the team it absolutely was, and we've continue to evolve it since. I think it was kind of imperative that if we have Vriska go through another arch, something about her and her role has to change, this is an entirely different challenge she's never had before and that's the opportunities you chase after when writing.<br>Also WAAAAH thank you!! That means a lot, I really appreciate you reading, I learned so much while making that comic I'm so grateful to the team and HSBC for letting me use the years I molded my homestuck skills to good use.</p>

(besides the art being awesome that's not really a question)</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> Criticism is necessary part of the story reader engagement, people are allowed to not agree with our choices as writers because they are choices not rock solid, visions of truth that come to us in visions. Honestly, I think what I'd love to see is how people would handle things differently if handed these same scenarios. When I disagreed with Homestuck as a fan, I did that a lot and it built my ability as a writer so much and it has a soft place in my heart to see love put into fanon like that.<br>As for whose “right” I wanted to answer this question very genuinely and say that it was really important to us in the writer's room that the argument in the last update felt real to the characters and their differing values (and consistent to the continuity of what has happened to them up until this point in the story). That meant flawed perspectives, lacking context or driven by trauma and emotion. Utilitywise, this is a convo less about whose right and whose wrong but instead bringing the characters into awareness about each other and just where they stand after avoiding all their differences for 20+ years.</p>
                <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> We are going to write the story we write, but it is important to be able to listen to your audience and make them feel heard. Sure, there is a bit of bad faith among the valid criticism but it actually just means a lot to me that anyone cares enough to have an opinion. If they didn't care at all they would just leave.<br>Who's in the right? Sollux. This shit sucks and it's not fun, so, he left.</p>

                <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> I think my favorite panels are anything with intense action in them because I can always get stylistically experimental with them, hehe. The Jake vs Jane update was a riot, anything with Hell Tier Vriska, and also the recent panel with all the adults in Guardian Mode lookin' down at John I'm real happy about!</p>
                <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> My favorite panels to make are stuff made for the Flash! In the comic, I liked how the Rose-covering-Harry-and-Vrissy's-Eyes panel turned out!</p>
                <p class="answer author-haven"><strong>HAVEN:</strong> So many, The Home on page 592 almost killed me while I was working on it but it fills me with joy, literally any panel with Al, the Dirk and Terezi panels during the previous 4/13 update, the Jane's severed head panel i got to finalize over a kim sketch (the really scary crazy one), and “Kids: Escape from above." another awesome one I'm very proud of.</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> I haven't been drawing panels as long as everyone else, but I fucking loved drawing Jake's hopesplosion and winged stance in the flash, along with the Dead!Dave super close shot and Jade punching John. I was kicking my feet so much. Besides that, I loved boarding update 6, update 12 and this last update and watching them come to life.</p>
                <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> Something I stressed very early on in HSBCs production is that it is very purposeful when and how we see the characters in various modes, especially in Candy. In the latest update, when we get a command for John to “be present” we are seeing the small classic sprites that they had when they were children. When we switch to Vriska as the focus, the adults are relatively normal sized again. There is some switching around and the way character are portrayed kind of shifts here and there. Eventually we switch to back to John after the big punch and we see that he suddenly sees that everyone here is an adult, literally towering over him. Everyone has grown up but him. Kim really knocked it out of the park with this panel, and I feel like that's the high point in this whole act for me.</p>

I think the only thing so far that expanded much more in scope than we expected was the [S] page where Vriska was getting absorbed into the Plot Point portal. We talked about it in a past artist commentary on the Patreon, but I think the writers initially just proposed it as a fancy gif.

Just one central question: with the Nipah in Vriska hell and Kyrie Rose from the patreon, as well as Rose's attempted suicide in 8r8k visually referencing Urasawa's monster, homestuck seems to finally be becoming anime.<br>How has the process of selecting new pop cultural reference points to work into the language of the comic been going? Are there works that you would consider key touchstones for your approach to the comic in terms of influence? And have Homestuck and Umineko secretly been the same thing all along?</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> TBF I haven't seen The Monster anime yet, only read the manga so I can't say that my contribution is making Homestuck anime. But I would say with referencing things, we focus on things that are really important to us and not just passing fancy or currently relevant. EX. I wanted to reference Monster because I felt like the nihilism of Johan would add so much context to the Rose's own suicide. But also Monster as a whole has really influenced me along with all of Satoshi Kon's work.</p>

                <p class="question author-stoicphoenix"><strong>Q:</strong> I love the comic so far! I was wondering what your panel workflow is? I'm working on an MSPFA with some friends and I want to know how your write/revision/write goes!</p>
                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> The writers start by all getting together and trying to roughly outline basic plot beats, then refining that outline down to “update by update” chunks. Then, when it comes time to write a given update, we currently all get together and write it together in call! Floral is a fantastic boarder so we tend to sort of write and board simultaneously, then comes finished dialogue/narrative passes, and then we see which artists want to do which panels, or if a given artist wants to take a whole update for the final panels! Lots of input and collaboration happens between writers and artists on all steps, though. We try, and fail, but really try, to lock things in early, but every now and then one of us looks at what we've got and realizes we have a tweak we just HAVE to make. Nothing bad ever happens because of this.</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> As for art, we've been playing with different workflows recently but ones the thumbnails are done by the writers, and a color script has been made, we push the update along to the assigned artist, and we'll do art jams as a team if there is any visual development in need of …. developing.</p>

                <p class="question author-reasonable_clue4648"><strong>Q:</strong> Hello. First time sending questions to an AMA ever, so apologies if I don't understand site etiquette.<br><br>1: For any of the writers/artists, is there any character that you dislike working on? And not because you dislike the character or anything, its just annoying getting them exactly right. (If the answer involves someone we haven't seen yet, yk feel free to ignore this).<br><br>2: For the writers, HS can be absurd a good majority of the time, and that's part of the humor. So I have to ask how do you balance that absurdity/humor out, personally? Like what is your mindset to make sure that neither you nor the audience overindulge in either end of zaniness/melodrama, and just get numb to it? When do you pump the brakes?<br><br>3: For anyone, is there anything you would've done differently with act 1 now that you can look back at it? Like if you had the dream of infinite money, infinite time, and the world wasn't constantly on fire/on the brink of catching fire, would you have changed something?<br><br>Thank you for reading, even if you don't answer; have a good day/night.</p>
                <p class="answer author-miles"><strong>MILES:</strong> Welcome to AMA's! Thank you for joining us :J 1: I think the character I dislike writing the most is John, honestly, because I feel like I have to think the hardest about getting his weird-ass mindstate exactly right. He's a bit less intuitive for me than a lot of the other characters, and feels a bit more informed by the scenes he shows up in than driven by a Really Strong Voice in the way that other characters are. Still fun, but I'll admit he's tough! 2: For the humor balance, it's really trial and error. We know the dramatic beats well in advance, but humor often emerges when we're actually writing the final pass/script versions of the updates, and it often just comes down to: how good is the joke, and is there enough space for the drama to shine on its own if we include it? We do a lot of readthroughs of the updates in call to get a sense of the momentum of the scene, and it's usually during those that it becomes clear if a joke is Too Much or hurts the scene more than it helps it. Luckily, though, Homestuck juggles comedy and tragedy pretty frenetically, so we have a lot of wiggle room! 3: To be honest, nah? I love what we did with Act 1. Maybe if we could have just gotten all the Hell-tier VN updates out faster so it wasn't like two solid months of it, but I love what we did for it anyway so it's not too much a thorn in my side.</p>
                <p class="answer author-kim"><strong>KIM:</strong> I don't know why, but Aradia is always so tricky for me to draw… She's got such a specific vibe to her expression and attitude, and I find I keep challenging myself to get it right. Her schrodinger's horn shape in the base comic don't help either LOL.</p>
                <p class="answer author-andi"><strong>ANDI:</strong> Not particularly. I'm trying to think of which character took the LONGEST for me to get right, but I'm otherwise okay with drawing. I think it'd be Dirk. I remember the scene where BGD took off his glasses, I was seriously going through several forms of torture trying to get his eyes to look right on a face that has NEVER had even so much as an implication of the eye. Everyone else has been pretty straightforward for me. My main struggles are more technicalities, rather than character designs.</p>
                <p class="answer author-chumi"><strong>CHUMI:</strong> I think AlCal was the hardest for me to draw, even though I did a whole update for her. I just never drew that much of her before HS:BC!</p>
                <p class="answer author-floral"><strong>FLORAL:</strong> 1. Honestly even if I don't have strong opinions on a character, once I get to writing them I usually end up loving them. As for characters, I only don't like boring characters and thankfully Homestuck is pretty good about not having those. 2. Honestly I think the biggest strength of us as writer's is that we aren't afraid of ridiculous ideas, but are committed and critical about justifying them. I love stupid and insane but it can't be try hard or random. 3. If we had INFINITE money, probably make the flash a little bit longer. But besides that, everything is amazing, and everyone has really taken every part of Act 1 and exceeded my expectations with it.</p>

                <p class="answer author-james"><strong>JAMES:</strong> here it is ok. sheesh. i spent such a long time looking for this question just now and ended up answering a handful of different ones LMAO.<br>So previously the music was done on a sort of volunteer basis, with the forums acting as a sort of central hub for a selected team of people. I'd like to do something similar, and offer compensation in the form of percentage of the album sales, much like the old set up. Only the percentage would be larger and the team, overall, would be smaller. Right now I'm not certain how to recruit for a new music team without flooding my inbox with submissions that I will sadly have to turn most of down.<br>I am thinking I will approach people individually and build up a small team of collaborators and contributors sort of like how it was done before with the caveat that I am very open to suggestions and recommendations. I said before that I'd love to have some of the old team back as well, if they'd be willing to Get The Band Back Together but I'd also understand their apprehension to work with WP/HICU or I. I also want to give opportunities to new and upcoming musicians as well. I have a few people in mind and i'll build from there.<br>if you guys have suggestions on individual artists I should be listening to, I'd love to hear them.</p>

                <p class="question author-monkeyboyinc"><strong>Q:</strong> Throughout Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff's original run, I think you have to agree that there is a certain continuity to the art. Old elements are used and reused, time and time again, in ways that they really should not be used. These elements get exaggerated over time, with errors that arose due to distortions being incorporated into the art style. The path from from <a href="https://i.imgur.com/662V3KM.png">this</a> to <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vPjrEB4.png">this</a> to <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VWSkWvS.png">this</a> is traceable and makes sense, albeit in its own twisted way.<br><br>However, the upcoming Quest for the Missing Spoon book seems to have a brand new art style, one which has super-deformed proportions from the very start if <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NqokAHc.png">this</a> is anything to go by. With this seeming reboot to the art's continuity, do you feel you've earned the right to start out this shit with this new style? And furthermore, will this new style undergo an evolution throughout the book akin to the one that the original comic went through? Thanks.</p>

Andrew Hussie mentioned editing some of the pages, but I'm not sure what this means in practice.</p>
                <p class="answer author-kcgreenn"><strong>KC GREEN:</strong> Yeah, Hussie has the only power to "Deeped Frie" the images as per everyone's usual desire. But we are telling a narrative too. one that you can actually follow. so i guess there needs to be some leeway and compromise.</p>
                <p class="answer author-horse_enjoyer"><strong>ANDREW:</strong> It is not correct to say that SBAHJ comics must always look like the worst possible garbage. In truth there is an acceptable range. Some pages can look kind of ok, others will look like they've been deep fried to hell and back. If you make it a rule that everything must be deep fried to the max then suddenly you lose the ability to appreciate some of the exceptionally putrid looking material. If everything looks like shit, nothing does. I went through and applied just the right amount of jpeg loss and artifact scum to every page, as needed. Some pages have a light touch, others are complete abominations.</p>

It's hard to find the line of "trying too hard" when doing comedy, and looking back at a lot of older work would have me rolling my eyes at it than going "oh that was good." I've learned to let it go if I get stuck wondering if something will land or if I like another joke more over another. cus it will just lead me no where, personally.

          <subtitle>This AMA took place on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/9ilope/i_am_mayonaka_with_proof_ama/">/r/homestuck</a> the 26th of September of 2018, to explain and clarify some details about the Midnight Crew and the Felt fanventure by their creator, Professor Mayonaka. It started with this post:</subtitle><br><br>
          <div class="qa-pair">
            <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> I doubt many will recognize that name, but for those who do, and for whom the Midnight Crew's conception, the Felt adventure, and that mysterious necklace remain of some interest, this is for you.<br><br>

            It's December 15th, 2008. I'm 17 years old and, like many, I've found myself swept up in the growing internet phenomena that is Problem Sleuth. In my spare time, I'm developing a D&D campaign for my friends, and one of the core factions of that world is the Midnight Crew. In it, they are a mafia-like structure of interplanar criminals. The Midnight Crew's name did not originate from any song, nor was it a reference to anything, I only thought it sounded cool.<br><br>

            Upon seeing that Andrew Hussie is willing to illustrate any comic page for a small donation, I decide to submit my idea to him. I did so under the username Mayonaka, which is simply Midnight in Japanese. What I gave Andrew was by no means comprehensive, and many, many facets of the Midnight Crew characters themselves were purely his creation. It struck a cord with the community and soon other donors were paying to see more of the Midnight Crew.<br><br>

            Fast forward many years and we're deep into Homestuck. Due to the Midnight Crew's popularity in Problem Sleuth (I assume), Andrew decides to make them a major part of his next story. Perhaps unwisely, I decided to step back into the spotlight through the MSPA Forums (may they rest in peace). With the forum handle "Professor," my first adventure there was not The Felt, but actually a strange story titled Voices. It had nothing to do with MSPA, Homestuck, or the Midnight Crew, but gained some small attention. After a short time, I decided to come out as Mayonaka, both to the community and to Andrew, and started a new adventure based on his works.<br><br>

            The Felt was my take on the rival organization Andrew had created for the Midnight Crew, and also explored some of my ideas for where he could go with them. It is also something I regret, for reasons which should become clear by the end of this. Using my connection to the Midnight Crew's creation, I leveraged myself into a position of supposed "semi-canon." Andrew was very polite and helpful when I messaged him repeatedly during the process, as I was trying to ensure that my Felt comic lined up with his vision for the Homestuck world. In retrospect, I wish I had stuck with something new and non-derivative, as I imagine this had to have been a nuisance to Andrew; though he never came across to me as impatient at all.<br><br>

            In any case, the Felt comic gained a lot of readers and attention, but also controversy. Andrew was being very non-confrontational about the whole "semi-canon" thing. In fact, at my request, he actually put a pendant in one of the panels which was intended to be worn by Professor Mayonaka, a character invented for the Felt comic to be the Midnight Crew's equivalent to Lord English (named, of course, after my old username). Either way, because there wasn't a clear "answer from god" on whether my comic was part of the Homestuck canon or not, it became ground zero for a small war within the forums. Realizing my mistake, I set fire to it. The Felt is gone, you can scarcely find fragments of it if you look hard enough. I didn't keep a copy.<br><br>

            In any case, here's our original email correspondence during the donations as proof. Ask me anything.<br><br>

              <p class="question author-moreepicthanyou747"><strong>Q:</strong> Dude, you're the stuff of legend around here. Well, you're the stuff of obscure, arcane Huss-tory trivia, but given that this is MSPA we're talking about here that might as well be legend. Thanks for showing up here.<br><br>Do you ever think you had a personal impact on Hussie withdrawing from his fans, or is that more the responsibility of the Act 5 fandom explosion that happened later than your Felt adventure?<br><br>Did you ever keep up with Homestuck afterwards? If so, what did you think about the direction the story took in the second half of the comic, especially the ending? If not, would you ever want to read the rest of it, and where exactly did you quit?<br><br>Have you done any more creative projects you think are worth sharing? You're clearly a pretty creative person-- even if you didn't have much input on the Midnight Crew, your Felt adventure is remembered well for a reason.</p>
              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> I certainly hope not. I doubt it. Andrew has always been nothing but kind to me in our interactions. If I had to guess, the fandom probably just got too big for one guy.<br><br>I did read Homestuck through to completion. I liked it well enough, but it got a little complex and hard to follow for me personally.<br><br>I've done some art for a small indie game company called Perfect Square Studios, you can find a few of their games on Steam.</p>

I've seen so many people talk about the pendant now that it's practically legend in my relatively newcomer eyes.</p>
              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> The comic eventually grew too complex for me to follow toward the end, but I am very excited for Andrew's game.<br><br>And the Felt were already in the comic before I started mine. My &quot;Felt&quot; comic was based on, and basically a prequel to, Andrew's sequence in which the Midnight Crew infiltrated their mansion.</p>

At the time, however, I didn't want to risk its existence being a thorn in Andrew's side as he moved forward with his own story.

And don't worry about whatever cringe you caused for Andrew or the forums; if there's one rule in this fandom, it's that there's always someone cringier than you. Hecc, I once re-enacted the Equius/Gamzee scene in Murderstuck at a con where there were no other Homestucks, in front of my friends who had no idea why I was so happy about a Skyrim reference.<br><br>Have you ever considered doing another adventure? There isn't really enough of us left to start a real flame war, and your ideas obviously click with us.

              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> It's not out of the question.  <br><br>Hypothetically, if I did start something, I would probably run it very much like the original Problem Sleuth. Small scope, personal, comedic, and loose.</p>

              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> With the MSPA forums gone, that's very difficult to answer with exact dates. What I can tell you is that it started shortly after the conclusion of Andrew's first Midnight Crew &quot;intermission&quot; in which they fought their way through the Felt's mansion, and that it came to an end a few months after that.</p>

              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> I didn't request it, but I think it was probably a reference to the discussions Andrew and I had had about Professor Mayonaka. He was intended to be composed of a sort of inky, black, ooze-like material; the product of experiments he'd conducted on other Dersites and himself.</p>

              <p class="question author-fossilbedroom"><strong>Q:</strong> Who's your favorite Midnight Crew member? And what were their original personalities, as shadow mages in your D&D campaign?<br><br>Are you following Hiveswap, or are you mostly dis-attached to the fandom now? Do you think the paradox space comic on the Felt took some likenesses from your Felt comic?<br><br>Sorry that I have so many questions!! I'm just excited to see an important piece of Homestuck here.</p>
              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> Probably Spades. In the original D&D campaign, the faction was pretty large and its members weren't really defined characters aside from Mayonaka, who was actually a minor deity living in the shadow plane.  <br><br>I am meaning to play Hiveswap at some point. I have not read any Paradox Space comics, but I'll make a point of checking that out.</p>

              <p class="question author-waibanshedo"><strong>Q:</strong> Dude, thank you so much for making them, the Midnight Crew are probably all in my top 10 favorite characters in HS, and maybe of all time. <br><br>Anyway, a few questions:<br><br>Which of the crew was your favorite to see Hussie create? <br><br>In a battle royal, who would win in the crew (assuming base Spades, obviously)<br><br>How would you classpect the four?<br><br>Do you like the Ms. Paint ship?<br><br>And finally, (based on what you read/know) which version of Spades is your favorite, between Problem Sleuth's, Prototyped, Cyborg, and Lord English Jack?</p>
              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> Some of these questions assume I have better knowledge/memory of Homestuck details than I actually do. But I'm gonna give it my best shot.<br><br>Spades is my favorite member.<br><br>I feel like he could take the rest of them in a battle royale, personally.<br><br>I think they'd all just be Thieves of Shadow or something like that, at least in the original concept, it doesn't make much sense to me for them to have one of the traditional classpect powersets.<br><br>I don't really have an opinion on Ms. Paint.<br><br>I prefer the Problem Sleuth Spades.</p>

              <p class="question author-realbillwatterson"><strong>Q:</strong> honestly cool thread. all i have to say is, if it helps, i respect the fact that you grew up and owned up to it. some people in hs and other fandoms seem unable to do that kind of thing.<br><br>also, i always figured the eddie morton connection was intentional, and now have been proven wrong. incredible</p>
              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> Yup, total coincidence. Midnight Crew meant nothing besides being an appropriate name for a mob with shadow/darkness themed powers.</p>

              <p class="question author-a_blessed_feline"><strong>Q:</strong> What were your plans for the Felt adventure and Mayonaka?<br><br>How much did Andrew reveal to you about things such as the Midnight Crew and their nature as carapacians, the Felt and their nature as leprechauns, and Lord English and his origins?</p>
              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> It's the damnedest thing, I honestly can't remember. I did have a direction, but it's totally lost to me now. In fact, I remember very little of what even happened in the Felt comic.<br><br>Basically none of that. Andrew did tell me some stuff about Lord English, but he didn't dive too deep into things. I suspect he may not have fully decided on all those things at the time, though I can't know. Homestuck always struck me as something where Andrew would breadcrumb a bunch of narrative hooks and then sort of figure out what to do with them later.</p>

              <p class="question author-that-anon"><strong>Q:</strong> Woah, it's kind of exciting for me to get to directly communicate with someone who had some sort of influence in both in canon and the fandom! I'm a relatively new fan, having joined after the comic ended (although it's actually been two years since I was a fan! Time does fly). <br><br>How active are you in the fandom at the moment, and if not, are you planning to rejoin it? Or do you just want to leave your past mistakes behind? We've all made really cringy mistakes, you shouldn't feel bad about yourself. If Andrew was ok with it, then maybe you weren't as bad as you remember. Hussie *can* be pretty asshole-ish to his fans. <br><br>Also, I thought you should know that I found an archive of The Felt on MSPFA. Only 5 images remain, but there are more than 100 pages of text. Just letting you know.</p>
              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> Andrew was never anything but completely friendly in his interactions with me. Although considerable time has passed since then.<br><br>I have not been active in the community since my adventures ended.</p>

              <p class="question author-takfloyd"><strong>Q:</strong> You are seriously overestimating how much any of this matters. There's nothing to &quot;regret&quot; or apologize for about what you did, Homestuck is just some comic drawn by some guy. Causing controversies about canon in a random webcomic is just above &quot;spilling pee on the toilet seat&quot; on the crime severity ranking, and putting your pendant in the comic wasn't some major favour that Hussie did for you, it's not like it took any effort. <br><br>So don't be dramatic about it and just enjoy the fact that your OCs got to be internet famous.</p>

              <p class="question author-1011686"><strong>Q:</strong> Oh i should probably mention, im kind of researching the history of MSPA-inspired adventures to write a thing about them, which is why i asked you that. And i thought of another thing to ask. So, what was the general mood around forum adventures and (how) did it change as time went on?</p>
              <p class="answer author-xandavis"><strong>MAYONAKA:</strong> To me, it felt like we were preserving the spirit of Problem Sleuth. Homestuck had grown into this big thing, and kind of forgotten its roots; which isn't bad! It grew up, it became something better, but also different. So for people who wanted that small, personal feel to their adventure, that's where the forum adventures came in.</p>
