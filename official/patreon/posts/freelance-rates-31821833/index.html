      <p> </p><p>The level of support for the Homestuck Patreon has been overwhelming, and What Pumpkin couldn&#8217;t be more thankful this Thanksgiving. Fans want to support the independent artists behind their favorite works, and What Pumpkin has gotten to business making it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>In early November, What Pumpkin founder Andrew Hussie and the freelance creative and technical team behind <span class="caps">WP</span>&#8217;s projects agreed on a significant increase in rates for the art, writing, music and code that makes the expanding Homestuck and Hiveswap universe&nbsp;possible.</p><p>Too often, the comics and games we enjoy – even big-budget corporate media – are made in unhealthy and unsustainable &#8220;crunch&#8221; environments. The direct support and generosity of Homestuck fans helps to ensure better conditions for&nbsp;everyone.</p><p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The point of the Patreon wasn&#8217;t only to fund <span class="caps">HS</span>^2. There are dozens of people working on Homestuck games and projects, and almost all of them came from the fandom originally. So they&#8217;re spread across everything we&#8217;re doing, like Hiveswap, Friendsim, Pesterquest, and now <span class="caps">HS</span>^2, contributing art, writing, music and programming. The Patreon is a good way for fans who love what they&#8217;re doing to contribute to their overall compensation outside of game sales alone. Before the Patreon existed, there really wasn&#8217;t a coherent means of showing more support for the people working on all this. Unless you wanted to buy multiple copies of the games? Which I certainly don&#8217;t discourage. But I thought maybe we could come up with something better, which is also attached to a cool new project. The better the Patreon does, not only does everyone at the studio benefit, but the more you&#8217;ll see <span class="caps">HS</span>^2 start to pick up the pace,&#8221; said What Pumpkin founder Andrew&nbsp;Hussie.</p><p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It was important to the Homestuck^2 team that fans&#8217; enthusiasm and support was shared with everyone working with What Pumpkin, and Homestuck&#8217;s community has again proved itself the greatest fandom around,&#8221; said Homestuck^2 co-director Aysha U.&nbsp;Farah.</p><p>The workers that benefit from these contributions are active on the following&nbsp;projects:</p><ul> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1181840/HIVESWAP_Act_2/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><u><span class="caps">HIVESWAP</span>: <span class="caps">ACT</span> 2</u></a> is the anticipated second entry in the four-part series of narrative adventure games from the universe of <em>Homestuck</em>. Hiveswap has something for you, whether you&#8217;re a dedicated fan or just now discovering the fandom&nbsp;phenomenon.</li> <li>Embark on a quest of epic importance in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144030/Pesterquest/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><u><span class="caps">PESTERQUEST</span></u></a>, a grimsical episodic visual novel set in the darkly funny <em>Homestuck</em>/<em>Hiveswap</em> universe. Dive deeper into Homestuck lore in this rich visual novel with an unapologetically irreverent&nbsp;story.</li> <li><a href="https://homestuck2.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><u><span class="caps">HOMESTUCK</span>^2: <span class="caps">BEYOND</span> <span class="caps">CANON</span></u></a> is an official continuation of the cult-classic webcomic Homestuck and a follow-up to <em>The Homestuck Epilogues</em>, dropped as a major event in April of this year. Homestuck 2: Beyond Canon takes a combination of Andrew Hussie&#8217;s original writing and plot outlines and concepts and joins him with a team of new, diverse voices to expand the compelling narratives of Homestuck&#8217;s most (and least) beloved&nbsp;characters.</li></ul><p>2019 has been an incredible journey, with numerous releases for our fans. With this support, expect even more announcements from What Pumpkin in 2020 and&nbsp;beyond!</p><p><a href="http://whatpumpkin.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><u><strong>What Pumpkin</strong></u></a> is an independent studio founded by Andrew Hussie, author and artist behind cult classic webcomic Homestuck. It brings together a diverse team with a passion for telling new stories in Homestuck and Hiveswap&#8217;s vast universes and a love for the worldwide community and culture that surrounds their&nbsp;work.</p>
