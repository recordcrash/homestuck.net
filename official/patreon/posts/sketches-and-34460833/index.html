      <p>Alright, motherfuckers, strap in. Time for more of this <span class="caps">ABSOLUTE</span> <span class="caps">NONSENSE</span>.</p><p>Catnapped is some of the most fun I’ve had while writing, because Jasprose is just so goddamn fun. Cats don’t plan, they live in the moment. She’s always existing in that moment of pushing a glass off the&nbsp;table.</p><p>After expanding the canvas vertically in the main update this month, I wanted to go wide with this one. Just like Homestuck started very conventionally and slowly began to shift the boundaries of its medium, I think we’re all settling in to more comfort and confidence on this project and starting to loosen the&nbsp;format.</p><p>Plus, I knew Haven would absolutely kill it with the art. This speakeasy is <span class="caps">HOPPING</span>, and there&#8217;s so many great details in the background. Every time I see this guy, I lose my shit&nbsp;laughing:</p><p><img data-media-id="55506556" src="../../posts/sketches-and-34460833/34460833_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part Three_02_1.png"/></p><p> <span class="caps">BONK</span>!</p><p>Let&#8217;s go left to right and talk about each of Jasprose&#8217;s&nbsp;conversations.</p><ol> <li>First, I actually really appreciate getting a lot at Jane&#8217;s genuine sympathy for Dirk here. There was quite a bit of mutual fondness and care between the two of them – but, at the same time, they enabled each others&#8217; worst tendencies. Jasprose displays her most tact yet here. Well, as much tact as you can display while complimenting someone&#8217;s &#8220;ample&nbsp;bosom.&#8221;</li> <li>I really could go into a long talk about Hysterical Dame, Nervous Broad, and the deep current of gender that suffuses the entire story of Problem Sleuth, which you really should read if you haven&#8217;t yet. I&#8217;ll keep it to this, though: The two of them had stories that revolved around each other and became more powerful together. Despite their disparaging names casting a lamplight on the sexism that usually pervades a detective noir setting, these two girls got some of the coolest moments, the best gear, and were really the first of the MSPAverse&#8217;s now storied lineage of badass women. I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;re&nbsp;married.</li> <li>Oh, Jake. I wonder how long he&#8217;s been awake at this point. Again, despite her role as a chaos agent, Jasprose seems to find herself being&#8230;sweet? Her disastrous idea of an English presidential run is shot down and she backs off immediately. The little moment of friendship over Jake&#8217;s respect for Jasprose&#8217;s unique identity – probably easier for him, since he never really knew Rose – does warm the heart. Really glad he&#8217;s not running, though. That leaves room&nbsp;for&#8230;</li> <li>Swifer! Swifer remains the closest thing to a &#8220;straight man&#8221; this story has. (Not in the sexuality way. In the comedy way.) She&#8217;s something like a Kermit figure, the average person unconnected to the pantheon, trying her best to make this show run. She&#8217;s in over her head, which is a pretty common emotion for women thrust into positions of power. Cliper really is her rock, and he picks up what Jasprose&#8217;s intent is right away: Electoralism. If she wants to do it, Swifer could be a formidable candidate in a way that none of the gods really could. Hatched and raised on Earth C, she presents a friendly face that makes Jane&#8217;s stoking of fear about the Mother Grub look ridiculous. Jasprose is definitely fibbing a bit, here, about Jane already agreeing&#8230;but she&#8217;s fairly confident she&#8217;ll get what she wants. &gt;;3c. Also Swifer has no idea what to do when being flirted with. It&#8217;s very&nbsp;cute.</li> <li>There was no universe where we left this story without Jasprose saying &#8220;owo what&#8217;s this&#8221;. You know it, I know&nbsp;it.</li></ol><p> </p><p>Now what the fresh fuck has Dad Crocker gotten himself into??? Already imprisoned by <span class="caps">DD</span> once in his life, he now finds himself handcuffed to the most dapper Midnight Crew members. Maybe we&#8217;ll get to see a little more about how this came&nbsp;about?</p><p>If you&#8217;ve watched <em>Parasite</em> (you should, we&#8217;ve almost all seen it and loved it), you&#8217;ll recognize Kim Ki-taek&#8217;s wisdom about plans in Jasprose&#8217;s hectic improvisation: The best plan is no plan at all. Where are we off to next? You&#8217;ll just have to wait find&nbsp;out.</p><p>God, Problem Sleuth just has the worst commuting luck. He should put some of his rug money into a permanent locksmith. Checking back in with these scenes is always a delight. It probably took <span class="caps">PS</span> like two hundred off-screen panels to get to this point.&nbsp;Miserable.</p><p>That&#8217;s another month of commentary! Thanks again for being the most devoted supporters of our little project here. It means a lot to get to wax poetic to you, and I hope you enjoy the additional glimpse into our weird&nbsp;heads.</p><p>Enjoy these delightful bonus sketches from&nbsp;Haven:</p><p><img data-media-id="55506644" src="../../posts/sketches-and-34460833/34460833_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part Three_03_1.png"/></p><p><img data-media-id="55506652" src="../../posts/sketches-and-34460833/34460833_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part Three_04_1.png"/></p><a href="../../posts/sketches-and-34460833/34460833_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part Three_01_thumbs.png"></a>
