      <p>Dear, sweet, precious patrons&#8230; it&#8217;s amazing to think that we&#8217;ve been together for just an entire year. A year! It sure has been: one whole year since we started Homestuck^2. Oh how the time has&nbsp;flown.</p><p>Not only has it been a year, but I think we can all agree that it has been A Year. Just a real stinker of a trip around the sun, this one. In light of the various&#8230; Things going on, we&#8217;d like to thank all of you for your continued support—it&#8217;s no trivial thing to be generous in difficult times. It really does mean the world to&nbsp;us.</p><p>To celebrate Homestuck^2&#8217;s birthday, the Patreon will be undergoing some changes for the better in the coming month. The most important of these&nbsp;is&#8230;</p><p><strong><span class="caps">THE</span> I-<span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;T-<span class="caps">KNOW</span>-<span class="caps">WHY</span>-<span class="caps">WE</span>-<span class="caps">DIDN</span>&#8217;T-<span class="caps">DO</span>-<span class="caps">THIS</span>-<span class="caps">SOONER</span> $10 <span class="caps">TIER</span></strong></p><p>That&#8217;s right. A $10 tier is on its way. Mathematically, economically, aesthetically&#8230; there are just so many ways in which it makes sense. We really don&#8217;t know why we didn&#8217;t do this&nbsp;sooner.</p><p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>But <span class="caps">WHAT</span> will this tier get me?&#8221; This is an excellent question, brain-ghost patron. For pledging to the $10 tier, not only will you get access to all the bonus updates as usual, but every month you will be the recipient of a gorgeous, brand-new illustration by one of our brilliant artists, tailor made to be saved immediately as your new phone background, and featuring your favorite characters from the Homestuck and Hiveswap universe. It&#8217;s one high-res <span class="caps">PNG</span> file every month. What could it cost? 10 dollars? It turns out that it costs exactly 10 dollars in&nbsp;fact.</p><p>The first of these illustrations will be released to patrons in November. Also, starting in November, a poll will be published each month for all $10+ patrons to vote for one of four potential prompts, with the winning choice determining the illustration for that month. If you have an idea that you don&#8217;t see represented in a given month, suggest it in the comments! If you truly have a burning desire to see Kankri in a Christmas sweater, then (deep sigh) feel free to tell us just that. It may well end up in a future&nbsp;poll.</p><p><strong><span class="caps">SOME</span> <span class="caps">LESS</span> <span class="caps">EXCITING</span> <span class="caps">NEWS</span></strong></p><p>The keen-eyed amongst you will have noticed that we dipped below the 2,000 patron threshold back in September, and have remained just shy of it since then. This means that there will be only one main update in November and December, and the update schedule will continue like this until we go back over the 2,000 mark. Bonus content will continue at the usual pace, and in their characteristically bonusy&nbsp;fashion.</p><p><strong><span class="caps">SOME</span> <span class="caps">MORE</span> <span class="caps">EXCITING</span> <span class="caps">NEWS</span></strong></p><p>You all probably know already, but in case you&#8217;ve been living under a rock for the past week: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1181840/HIVESWAP_Act_2/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="caps">HIVESWAP</span>: <span class="caps">ACT</span> <span class="caps">TWO</span></a> will be coming out&#8230; within the next month!!! This is it. We&#8217;re almost there. The team is hard at work getting the finishing touches ready for this long- and passionately-awaited release, so sit back, relax, and savor the last little bit of waiting. You&#8217;ve had plenty of practice at it by&nbsp;now.</p><p>Or, instead of twiddling your thumbs, you could brush up on your Alternian knowhow, and replay <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/833040/Hiveswap_Friendsim/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span class="caps">HIVESWAP</span> <span class="caps">FRIENDSIM</span></a><em> </em>in the meantime<em>. </em>Blow the dust off your favorite characters, or maybe discover some new ones! Get one last good whiff of that clown pit, whatever. Chase your&nbsp;bliss.</p>
