      <p>Panel&nbsp;-1 </p><p>a2: we’re establishing with an establishment shot because it’s been like 84 years since we’ve seen these&nbsp;motherfuckers. </p><p>Panels&nbsp;1-4 </p><p>A1 So much has happened since then. For us, I mean. For them, not so much. A perpetual closet panic for the last 3&nbsp;months. </p><p>a2: yeah, we’ve had a whole ass pandemic since any of this shit has happened. really makes you&nbsp;think. </p><p>A1 Damn it really does. I understand the pathos of this&nbsp;now. </p><p>A1 Anyway Harry Anderson is delightfully unaware and i love him for&nbsp;it</p><p>a2 a lot of this chapter has involved developing harry anderson, and he continues to be the only boy in the world for me. i love him dearly. what a little&nbsp;shit. </p><p>A1 I think it’s really important to discuss what a good water fountain entails. There’s always one in every school that’s better than the other ones and this is absolutely vital knowledge that Harry Anderson should be texting about with his girlfriend who goes to another&nbsp;school.</p><p>A2 when i was in high school we texted some, but it was still mostly phone conversations? i guess i am very old. nowadays i can’t imagine ever wanting to talk to someone on the&nbsp;phone. </p><p>A1 Rich coming from someone who is currently voice chatting with me right&nbsp;now.</p><p>a2 listen you are like my best friend, you don’t count as&nbsp;someone. </p><p>A1 You love to hear&nbsp;it.</p><p>a2 &#8212;who is difficult to talk&nbsp;to. </p><p>A1 [Gay&nbsp;emoji]</p><p>a2 anyway, i think the whole premise of this particular scene is extremely funny and also extremely scooby doo. like, whenever in actual life has anyone hid in a janitor’s closet? i doubt i could even have found the janitor’s closet in my high school. we just went into the band room to smoke&nbsp;weed. </p><p>A1 Ah, the classic high school experiences that happen only in&nbsp;fiction.</p><p>A1 I think people smoked weed on the tennis courts at my high school but I was a massive fucking uptight nerd,&nbsp;so.</p><p>a2 i got into fights in high school and also stole shit. i was actually probably a pretty shitty kid, but i got straight A’s so nobody noticed. i was also deeply fucking depressed. when you have good grades nobody cares if you’re troubled. just a little bit of my trauma here for the&nbsp;audience. </p><p>A1 Just like Tavros&nbsp;Crocker.</p><p>a2 i can’t believe you just made me tavros. well, actually, this tavros rules and i love&nbsp;him.  </p><p>A1 lmao. Harry Anderson is a solid C+ student and no one cares because of his other charms, which are&nbsp;plentiful.</p><p>a2 you wrote this part, do they really just leave gamzee’s body there? fucking power move. have this clown corpse, public school&nbsp;system. </p><p>A1 I know they’re going against the cardinal rule of gamzee corpse management, turning their backs on it. But they’ve weighed their options and this is the only thing they can really do. Plus he is like actually dead this time so it’s fine. Vriska knows&nbsp;this. </p><p>a2 yeah, drastic times etc. vriska really is on the next level here. she just made out with this guy and then choked him to death. and nobody here knows about that, as far as i can tell? like, they know she killed him. but the continuing theme is here that vriska is on like….a different playing field than the rest of them. like, they’re doing shenanigans and she is an actual&nbsp;warrior.  </p><p>A1 It’s not her first rodeo. Vrissy has a feeling about this later we will&nbsp;see.</p><p>Panels&nbsp;5-8</p><p>a2 so i did the meenah and karkat parts, and i completely beefed it in the first draft by doing it in second person. which is <span class="caps">SO</span> much easier to write homestuck voice in, btw. i always feel like i’m doing a crime when i write in third person for these&nbsp;people. </p><p>A1 It was so fucking funny when i started reading it and was like “wait&#8230;are we allowed to do this now? Are we just saying fuck it, 2nd person??” and then i told you what you’d done. Who knows. 5000 patrons and we’ll switch to 2nd person* (*not&nbsp;binding).</p><p>a2 yeah you always assume that i know what i’m doing, which is really amazing of you as a friend. but i usually&nbsp;don’t. </p><p>A1 I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Also I really wanted it to be&nbsp;true.</p><p>a2 anyway, enough bullshit. let’s talk about what really matters. candy karkat. or, as he’s been named in the fandom, big boss&nbsp;karkat. </p><p>A1 I have limited metal gear knowledge but I do know a babe when I see one, and Candy Karkat is&nbsp;that.</p><p>a2 of course, you guys haven’t seen him&nbsp;yet. </p><p>A1 All in good time. It’ll be worth it. Enjoy your crumbs for now. Let your thirst&nbsp;grow.</p><p>a2 it is actually deeply fucked up how metal gear the epilogue is in general, which is absolutely on purpose. because the authors are big metal gears. the eyepatch, for instance. although i guess more characters than big boss have an eye patch. eye patches are just&nbsp;sexy. </p><p>A1 Yeah Vriska’s is pirate&nbsp;flavored. </p><p>a2 yeah instead of deranged libertarian cult leader flavored. anyway karkat is not a libertarian. also he was a little tricky to write here, because i wanted him to still be karkat, i.e. grumpy and done with all of this shit, but also he’s middle-aged and a revolutionary leader. so he’s doubtless learned a little&nbsp;patience. </p><p>A1 Yeah, he’s become the thing he always wanted to be as a kid, but like. Not at all the way he’d imagined. Basic ass commentary i know, i just like to think about&nbsp;it.</p><p>a2: yeah. when he was a kid on alternia he had this overwhelming need for companionship and intimacy that he could only really fathom as a need for power, because of the place he grew up. he abandoned that pretty quickly once they were on the meteor and he had that gaping hole in him filled. i mean. you know what i mean. metaphorical hole. the only good leader is the person who doesn’t want to be a leader, etc.&nbsp;etc. </p><p>A1 Also I very much enjoyed meenah talking about karkat outlawing fish puns and then using one like half a page down. Karkat’s authority can only go so&nbsp;far.</p><p>a2: meenah is hard when you can’t do fish puns because you end up just veering into dave and&nbsp;roxy. </p><p>A1 Karkat checking twitter: A March 2020&nbsp;mood.</p><p>Panels&nbsp;9-19</p><p>A1 This part of the outline was written before final edits and additions (including the Candy chapter where John talks to Roxy and then goes on a drive with Harry Anderson) to the Epilogues were made, so in order to make the timeline work, I had to get Harry Anderson home from school, continue to go on the drive with his dad like he does in Candy, and get him back to meet up with the kids, while also getting Roxy out of the way. It was kind of a pain in the ass, but also I think it ends up a little funnier because this fuckin guy cannot stop making things harder for&nbsp;Vriska/Vrissy/Tavros. </p><p>a2 harry anderson is the friend who shows up two and a half hours late with starbucks, and he also got everybody’s orders&nbsp;wrong. </p><p>A1 And then makes sure everyone cashapps him for it&nbsp;anyway.</p><p>A1 I hope everyone has a great time picking apart Harry Anderson’s room and interests. He’s got exquisite taste. Pokemon: the first movie would make an excellent live action musical, and Alien vs. Predator is simply one of the finest films ever&nbsp;made.</p><p>a2 i like that they have time to engage in love triangle nonsense. because of course they do. also “i know john is depressed and long-winded now” made me laugh out loud. that’s part of Being An Adult,&nbsp;vriska. </p><p>A1 There’s always gotta be time for love triangle nonsense!! And lmao yeah, sorry Vriska. It comes with the territory (though to be fair, John has a pretty bad case at this&nbsp;point). </p><p>A1 Also i think Vriska is just sort of having fun poking at the dynamics between the other three, not really placing herself on a level with&nbsp;them? </p><p>a2 oh yeah, for sure. vriska is miles above these babies. also, she’s still half-convinced that this world isn’t&nbsp;real. </p><p>A1 Yeah, and Vrissy is like. Not totally sure where Vriska is coming from, but she can tell she has a lot going on, which she’s both jealous and afraid of. Homestuck is extremely good for giving us multiple versions of characters, but they don’t often end up interacting with one another directly. So this dynamic is maybe my favorite to write and think about right&nbsp;now.</p><p>a2 another reason i think you would like metal gear, there is a whole lot of clone&nbsp;interaction. </p><p>A1 Compelling.&nbsp;Noted. </p><p>A3: <span class="caps">WOAH</span> <span class="caps">HEY</span> <span class="caps">THERE</span> <span class="caps">FOLKS</span> <span class="caps">IT</span>&#8217;S
