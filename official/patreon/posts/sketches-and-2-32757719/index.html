      <p><img data-media-id="50289071" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_01_1.jpg"/></p><p><img data-media-id="50289566" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_02_1.png"/></p><p>I don&#8217;t know if you noticed, but everything is terrible right now. And I don&#8217;t mean just in Homestuck&#8217;s dumb fake earth. I mean in our dumb real earth. Our planet is burning and folks go to bed hungry just so twelve guys can have more money than Croesus could have ever dreamed of. The concept of &#8220;truth&#8221; is at its most tenuous – political divisions involve contradictory interpretations of basic&nbsp;facts.</p><p>I&#8217;ve been playing a lot of <em>Death Stranding</em> recently. Basically any media that you&#8217;re making in 2019 has to either address what&#8217;s going on around us or come off sanitized, sterilized, with its head in the sand. Kojima offers a simple power fantasy: Through Norman Reedus&#8217;s sweaty, urine-filled labor, the things that divide us can be banished. America can be unified&nbsp;again.</p><p><img data-media-id="50289580" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_03_1.png"/></p><p>Jasprose here offers a similarly compelling fantasy for what to do about the tangled mess of problems created by rapacious plutocrats: Just kind of kidnap one and fuck&nbsp;off.</p><p>A lot of folks were dismayed at how Jane Crocker turned out in the two halves of this story. Jasprose gives a voice and a Cheshire Cat smile to that viewpoint. She&#8217;s a child of privilege – she grew up heiress to the world&#8217;s largest company. Notably, her kind and caring parental figure is the only one of any of the Sburb players guardians to&nbsp;survive.</p><p><img data-media-id="50289600" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_04_1.png"/></p><p>Privilege, safety, and inherited wealth do funny things to the brain. People justify to themselves why they have what they have. If you have enough for long enough, you start to convince yourself you <em>deserve </em>it.</p><p>Jane won the game, lost very little, and as god of a new world decided to dominate its markets as a corporate mogul. Her conception of what was possible with her capability and god-like reason was shaded, limited by the world she grew up in. She is not a goddess of fantasy, a semi-mythical trickster creature like Jasprose, or a meta-aware marionette master like&nbsp;Dirk.</p><p>She saw a new world and chose, simply, to replicate the power structures of the 21st-century America she was raised in. Boardrooms, power pantsuits, formality and&nbsp;professionalism.</p><p><img data-media-id="50289606" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_05_1.png"/></p><p>Jane&#8217;s favorite comic, a noir-detective drama steeped in the pop-cultural trappings of pulp Americana, reflects this&nbsp;mindset.</p><p>So, our catgirl Seer of Light takes us through the looking glass, and we get to see an old friend. Hi, Problem Sleuth! I like you a lot. Sorry for using you as a metaphor for reactionary thinking just&nbsp;now.</p><p><img data-media-id="50289235" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_06_1.png"/></p><p>Ignore all the political rabble-rousing. Funny detective man! New outfit! Outdated technology! I feel warmly ensconced in the womb of nostalgia, gently cradled on Norman Reedus&#8217;s chest. Haven did such a great job making this segment stand&nbsp;out.</p><p><img data-media-id="50289667" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_07_1.png"/></p><p><img data-media-id="50289670" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_08_1.png"/></p><p>We&#8217;ll check back in with our old friend from time to time and see what nonsense he&#8217;s surely gotten himself tangled in. But let&#8217;s check across town and listen in at the&nbsp;speakeasy.</p><p><img data-media-id="50289689" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_09_1.jpg"/></p><p><img data-media-id="50289693" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_10_1.png"/></p><p>(Pictured: Flinty&nbsp;Glasswipe)</p><p><img data-media-id="50289624" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_11_1.png"/></p><p>The most important part of this segment is Jake talking to Ace Dick in the background. Truly, this is a gravitational confluence of himbos so powerful as to create a singularity. So much meat, so few brain cells. I wonder what they&#8217;re even talking&nbsp;about.</p><p>Jasprose raises some interesting points here, between her extraordinarily forward flirting – picking up right where she left off with Jane seven years ago. Dirk&#8217;s abrupt exit from the Meat timeline seems to have created a bit of a power vacuum, an opportunity for&nbsp;change.</p><p><img data-media-id="50289637" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_12_1.png"/></p><p>Swifer and Cliper debate the happenings. They&#8217;re the closest thing to normal we&#8217;ve seen yet from this planet – the only characters we&#8217;ve met without any connection to the game or relation to any of those who played it. They are Earth C-born and hatched before the return of the creators. The two of them provide us an opportunity to look through the eyes of everyday residents of the world our heroes created as their return has completely upended&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, they have a great banter that seems to come from a lifelong friendship. Perhaps something more? I think diamonds look very good on them. Maybe you do,&nbsp;too.</p><p><img data-media-id="50289753" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757719/32757719_Sketches and Commentary_ Catnapped, Part 2_13_1.png"/></p>
