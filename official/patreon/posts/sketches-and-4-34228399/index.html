      <p>Hi everyone! We thought we&#8217;d do something a little different for the commentary this month, and bring you an exciting and <span class="caps">VERY</span> serious live discussion between two of the members of the writing team. What witty and engaging insights will they choose to share, I&nbsp;wonder&#8230;</p><p><img data-media-id="54793339" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_04_1.png"/></p><p><img data-media-id="54793352" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_05_1.png"/></p><p><img data-media-id="54793361" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_06_1.png"/></p><p><img data-media-id="54793371" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_07_1.png"/></p><p><img data-media-id="54793381" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_08_1.png"/></p><p>Pages&nbsp;119-123</p><p>A1: Gina’s art, though. To kick things&nbsp;off. </p><p>a2: oh my god gina&#8217;s art though. like holy shit are you seeing&nbsp;this?</p><p>A1: Those&nbsp;trees. </p><p>a2: that&nbsp;landscape.</p><p>A1: Whenever I try to comment on the art it’s always just like, Will Smith hands. <span class="caps">LOOK</span> <span class="caps">AT</span> <span class="caps">IT</span>! </p><p>I don’t know how to talk about art,&nbsp;really. </p><p>a2: i think that&#8217;s a pretty common experience among, well,&nbsp;artists.</p><p>a2: but then again i don&#8217;t know how to talk about&nbsp;anything.</p><p>a2: as will surely become apparent over the next like, 500 words or&nbsp;whatever.</p><p>A1: In commentaries I always really want to hyper-focus on a specific aspect of the story, and I know that’s not how they’re supposed to&nbsp;work. </p><p>A1: But yeah, Gina’s art really blew me away. It’s a pretty hard style pivot, but at the same time I think it works really well. Like&#8230;we’re on a new planet,&nbsp;right? </p><p>a2: yeah, for sure. homestuck has always been fond of changing up its art style to suit various moods and so on, so i think it lends itself well to having a variety of guest artists come in and make stuff their own. and i think gina really did that with this update,&nbsp;haha.</p><p>a2: from our perspective it&#8217;s a bit like magic really. we just write a handful of descriptive words, and then the artist comes back and it&#8217;s just the way you imagined, but invariably much better. and that takes an enormous amount of work and skill, and i&#8217;m so grateful to get to work with these&nbsp;people.</p><p>A1: Also they just really ate it, didn’t&nbsp;they? </p><p>A1: That ship. Terezi. You didn’t even&nbsp;try. </p><p>a2: i&#8217;d hate to see her &#8220;try&#8221; parallel&nbsp;parking.</p><p><img data-media-id="54793443" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_09_1.png"/></p><p>Page&nbsp;124</p><p>A1: *heart eyes emoji* is basically how I feel when I look at this&nbsp;panel. </p><p>A1: But in that old-fashioned cartoon way when the dude sees a sexy lady and then his eyes turn to hearts and bust out his damn&nbsp;face. </p><p>a2: not to toot our own horns here but i think it&#8217;s true to say that we really came through for the queer community in this update, in more ways than one. and in this case, xam&#8217;s rosebot design is just. oh my god. if there was any doubt that this project is populated by a whole lot of gay people, well. there&#8217;s your&nbsp;evidence.</p><p>A1: And this extremely Jojo pose is even more&nbsp;evidence. </p><p>A1: Rosebot’s outfit is based on a Greek chiton, but obviously orangier. Oranger. More&nbsp;orange. </p><p>A1: Actually, I have no idea if the ancient Greeks wore&nbsp;orange. </p><p>a2: i think it&#8217;s fair to say that whatever they wore, it could have stood to have been significantly&nbsp;orangerier.</p><p><img data-media-id="54793485" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_10_1.png"/></p><p>Page&nbsp;125</p><p>a2: so if on the previous page you were like, cartoonish heart eyes, on this page it&#8217;s much more like, damn bitch, you live like&nbsp;this? </p><p>a2: the team has relocated to a cave full of junk,&nbsp;apparently.</p><p>A1: “Let’s get down to business,” Dirk says. “Anime&nbsp;business.” </p><p>A1: This looks like a dorm&nbsp;room. </p><p>a2: although of course gina makes it look a lot more aesthetically pleasing than any dorm room in the history of&nbsp;creation.</p><p>A1: Actually I think a cave might have been nicer than some of the dorm rooms I’ve lived&nbsp;in. </p><p>A1: But enough of this&nbsp;bullshit. </p><p>A1: <span class="caps">TEREZI</span></p><p>a2: <span class="caps">LOOK</span> <span class="caps">AT</span> <span class="caps">HER</span></p><p>a2: aurgh i just&#8230; xam is soooo good at this stuff you guys. commentary is hard for me because often it just turns into a one-person fan club of my colleagues&#8217;&nbsp;work.</p><p><img data-media-id="54793522" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_11_1.png"/></p><p><img data-media-id="54793630" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_12_1.png"/></p><p>Page&nbsp;126 </p><p>A1: Back to sprites. Feels good, feels&nbsp;organic. </p><p>a2: yeah. i was pretty pleased with the little detail that rose&#8217;s light symbol clasp glows in the dark, that was&nbsp;neat.</p><p>A1: Terezi doesn’t want to participate in the philosophy, which honestly. Good for her. Get out of that&nbsp;cave. </p><p>a2: live your life free of bullshit. you earned&nbsp;it.</p><p>A1: The imagery is, admittedly, a little heavy-handed. Terezi leaving the cave for the light, the other two remaining in the darkness to talk endless circles around each&nbsp;other. </p><p>A1: The complacency of the&nbsp;learned. </p><p>a2: ohhhhh that&#8217;s the thing. like, the homestuck thing. i remember that one. we sure are&nbsp;smart.</p><p>A1: I love a&nbsp;refrance. </p><p><img data-media-id="54793637" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_13_1.png"/></p><p>Page&nbsp;127</p><p>A1: First of all, let’s get it out of the way: <span class="caps">WHAT</span> <span class="caps">ARE</span> <span class="caps">THOOOOSE</span></p><p>a2: hahaha. god. i have to admit that i fucking love those shoes and i want&nbsp;them.</p><p>a2: terezi&#8217;s whole outfit is something i would actually love to&nbsp;cosplay.</p><p>a2: i saw a lot of people doing edits of it after the upd8 dropped where they like, made the colors &#8216;better&#8217; or &#8216;more harmonious&#8217;, and while i absolutely respect and cherish all fanwork, i have to ask the people doing this: why the everloving fuck do you think terezi pyrope would give a shit about color&nbsp;theory.</p><p>A1: She puts together outfits solely on smell and&nbsp;taste. </p><p>A1: Don’t be a&nbsp;coward. </p><p>a2: right. she doesn&#8217;t care how loud it&nbsp;is.</p><p>a2: lots of people have been debating where she got that jacket from, or why it was that she grew her hair out. they&#8217;re very good questions. very good questions indeed. keep asking&nbsp;them.</p><p><img data-media-id="54793655" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_14_1.gif"/></p><p>Page&nbsp;128 </p><p>A1: I want to actually talk about some of the writing at some point, but I gotta comment on Dirk’s yaoi hand&nbsp;here. </p><p>A1: Just a big ‘ole&nbsp;hand. </p><p>a2: is a man not entitled to the size of his own&nbsp;hand?</p><p>a2: far more yaoi to my mind is the gay pink magic shit coming off&nbsp;it.</p><p>a2: there can be no heterosexual explanation for this,&nbsp;imo.</p><p>A1: Well, there’s nothing heterosexual about this cave in the least. This is an extremely gay&nbsp;cave. </p><p>a2: a gayve, if you&nbsp;will.</p><p>A1: I regret&nbsp;everything.</p><p><img data-media-id="54793667" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_15_1.png"/></p><p>Page&nbsp;129</p><p>A1: Rose ripping on Dirk’s clumsy philosophy references are honestly my favorite part of this&nbsp;chapter. </p><p>A1: There is honestly no excuse for calling your ship the Theseus. It&nbsp;sucks. </p><p>a2: yeah. whoever decided to call the ship that must have been a complete&nbsp;dipshit.</p><p>a2: dirk is clearly a much worse writer than we&nbsp;are.</p><p>A1: Every own on these characters is actually a self-own. Or an own on Andrew, I&nbsp;guess. </p><p>a2: yeah. it&#8217;s kind of like he handed us his precious children, whom we love, and we decided to repeatedly point out how silly they are. are we&#8230; are we bullies? are we cyber-bullying the characters of homestuck&nbsp;here?</p><p>A1: I think he cyber-bullied them&nbsp;first. </p><p>A1: Although I guess that’s like saying “hey if you didn’t want your kid to get bullied, why didn’t you have a better&nbsp;kid?” </p><p>A1: Also credit to my girlfriend who came up with the “Kant”&nbsp;joke. </p><p>a2: not to be vulgar, but one of my favorite things in the epilogues is the first canonical usage of the word &#8220;cunt&#8221;. it felt like it was long overdue. and of course, karkat had to be the pioneer in this&nbsp;regard.</p><p>A1: I really like that word! I wish it wasn’t so taboo. People say “dick” on American network <span class="caps">TV</span>.  </p><p>a2: you heard it here first, people. get out there and cunt it&nbsp;up.</p><p>A1: I think the most-quoted line from this chapter is the gay cowboy&nbsp;line. </p><p>A1: I guess this means we’ve sort of canonized Dirk’s Texas&nbsp;accent? </p><p>a2: yeah, but i think this was a foregone conclusion. the dude lived in post-apocalyptic texas, and he&#8217;s <span class="caps">ABSOLUTELY</span> the sort of person to adopt a long-dead accent for no reason other than historical&nbsp;accuracy.</p><p>Page&nbsp;130</p><p>a2: ok, so this is the big meaty words page. i think we could stand to talk more about the writing at this&nbsp;point.</p><p>A1: Yeah, this is the page that actually does most of the heavy-lifting in this update. We get through a lot here. And by that I mean, we sort of go in drunken circles of Dirk and Rose trying to out-bullshit each other and convince themselves they’re doing the right&nbsp;thing.</p><p>a2: we tried something a little different for the writing process of this update, which is that for large sections of the dialog we just rp&#8217;d the&nbsp;characters.</p><p>a2: andrew copied large sections of early homestuck from personal chatlogs with friends, and i always thought that lent it a special kind of humor and rapport that can be hard to capture by yourself. i think this approach worked pretty well for&nbsp;us.</p><p>A1: It was really wild, because after a while I kind of forgot I was talking to my friend and colleague and just felt like I was talking to Dirk&nbsp;Strider.</p><p>a2: that&#8217;s possibly the most terrifying thing anyone has ever said about&nbsp;me.</p><p>A1: I don’t know if that’s normal? I’ve actually never <span class="caps">RP</span>’d much&nbsp;before. </p><p>a2: oh, me neither. i think people do it a lot on the internet for horny reasons? but i think it&#8217;s heartening to know that we basically perfected the art style on the first try. go&nbsp;us.</p><p>A1: Philosophy <span class="caps">RP</span>. I mean, I guess Plato used to do this all the time, but he did it with his <span class="caps">OC</span>&nbsp;Socrates. </p><p>a2: right. his rps were of course, strictly&nbsp;platonic.</p><p>A1:&nbsp;Jesus. </p><p>A1: Moving right along. We see more of Dirk’s casual manipulation of Rose’s mental state, that he rationalizes away. It’s not actually that bad if she was going to agree anyway,&nbsp;right? </p><p>a2: i think a lot of the chapter deals with the kinds of paradoxical moral issues that seem to crop up so often in homestuck. i mean, it doesn&#8217;t deal with it in the sense that it comes up with an answer. but it&#8217;s a large part of what this chapter is&nbsp;about. </p><p>a2: what is the right thing to do when you&#8217;re functionally&nbsp;omniscient?</p><p>a2: or omni&#8230;whatever these kids&nbsp;are.</p><p>A1: Yeah, the question of whether morality actually has anything to do with running a system like this. Can god be&nbsp;moral?</p><p>a2: and of course, that&#8217;s kind of the same question that i ask myself a lot when writing. authorship is a peculiar&nbsp;thing.</p><p>a2: homestuck has never shied away from talking about the process of its own creation, and i think rose and dirk can function as avatars for author figures in this update, among other things. i was having feelings while writing&nbsp;them.</p><p>a2: i don&#8217;t know if it was the same for you,&nbsp;haha.</p><p>A1: I don’t know if I ever thought of it <em>consciously</em> like that, but it’s definitely there. The awareness they have that they are telling a story definitely changes the flavor of the&nbsp;experience. </p><p>Page&nbsp;130</p><p>A1: Everyone’s favorite thing: ectobiology. It’s been a&nbsp;minute. </p><p>A1: I love Dirk’s assurance of like, don’t worry, we aren’t going to cut off our arms and then make people out of&nbsp;that. </p><p>a2: don&#8217;t worry, i don&#8217;t want your stanky-ass rib or anything to make these new people out&nbsp;of.</p><p>A1: I think we did a fairly good job of getting the Adam and Eve references in there without it getting too&nbsp;weird. </p><p>a2: yeah. as much as that&#8217;s possible, really. biblical shit is just very weird and there&#8217;s no real way around&nbsp;it.</p><p>a2: i guess it&#8217;s appropriate that now dirk and rose are leaning hard into the Being God stuff, their lives start drawing even more heavily from various religious&nbsp;influences. </p><p>A1: Dirk especially has always had a kind of “epicness” around him. Last man on Earth, living at the top of a tower in the middle of an ocean. Everything he does smacks of&nbsp;destiny. </p><p>a2: i can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;d neglect to mention his most epic feature of all, which is of&nbsp;course:</p><p>a2: teh animes&nbsp;xD</p><p>A1: Yeah he’s a Kamina reference. Or maybe just an anime&nbsp;reference. </p><p>A1: I don’t think that Andrew had actually watched Gurren Lagann, he just saw a bunch of teens with those anime&nbsp;glasses. </p><p>A1: Anyway let’s go to another fucking&nbsp;cave. </p><p>a2: <span class="caps">LOL</span></p><p>Pages&nbsp;131-4</p><p>a2: this machine was fun to make. i think a lot of people, myself included, miss the era of homestuck where a lot of the action involved playing about with wacky technology. so this sequence was a personal&nbsp;favorite.</p><p>A1: You did an awesome&nbsp;job! </p><p>A1: I wanted to make sure we included some Rose and Dirk just actually having fun, or whatever passes for fun with the two of them. So far it had mostly been&nbsp;snarking. </p><p>A1: You know, just getting some quality time in. Dunking on god and the straights, slime ghosts. Normal&nbsp;stuff. </p><p>a2: that does sound uncannily similar to my real, actual&nbsp;life.</p><p>A1: All gay people have a slime&nbsp;ghost. </p><p>a2: we don&#8217;t talk about the slime&nbsp;ghost.</p><p>a2: the incestuous slurry mention gets another outing here. would it really be homestuck without it? also it&#8217;s an extremely fun phrase to type, i have to&nbsp;admit.</p><p>A1: Almost as fun as “genetic infidelity&nbsp;bonanza”. </p><p>a2: hahaha i was really pleased with that&nbsp;one.</p><p>a2: along with&nbsp;&#8220;SBaHJification&#8221;.</p><p>A1: I’m glad the Broblerone made an&nbsp;appearance. </p><p>a2: you know its a good update when the broblerone blesses you with its&nbsp;presence.</p><p>Pages&nbsp;135-6</p><p>a2: i was responsible for the animation on the sprite panels, which was fun. it&#8217;s obviously imitating andrew an awful lot, but i think that lends it an aura of homestucky authenticity. andrew is low-key really good at&nbsp;animation. </p><p>a2: the one on page 135 where the captchalogue cards fly onscreen and bump each other around was one i was pretty proud of. idk, it&#8217;s weird the things that you take satisfaction&nbsp;from.</p><p>A1: I don’t know the first thing about animation. I made one gif once. Never&nbsp;again. </p><p>a2: i also really like that rose and dirk look like they&#8217;re at a rave in a gay club on 136. that mental image is very&nbsp;fun.</p><p><img data-media-id="54793731" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_16_1.png"/></p><p>Page&nbsp;137</p><p>a2: another wonderful gina panel. i just love the composition of this one, and the way she draws&nbsp;dirk.</p><p>a2: her take on the classic homestuck hero mode is&nbsp;amazing.</p><p>A1: I have spent a lot of time staring at this panel, I love it so much. The pointy&nbsp;elbows. </p><p>Page&nbsp;138</p><p>A1:&nbsp;Behold&#8230;</p><p><img data-media-id="54793750" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_17_1.png"/></p><p>Page&nbsp;139</p><p>a2: our&nbsp;creation.</p><p>Pages&nbsp;140-142</p><p>A1: I think I remember saying “it should look like ditto but sick”, and then you were like “oh I’m way ahead of&nbsp;you.” </p><p>a2: hahaha, this little creature quickly jiggled its way into everyone&#8217;s heart, including&nbsp;mine.</p><p>a2: making deliberately shitty stuff is difficult, as it turns out. i tried not to spend too much time designing this, to give it that aura of stupidity that it deserved. but then i had like, an extended panic about it looking *too* shitty. making homestuck is weird like&nbsp;that.</p><p>A1: I’ve seen a lot of “Don’t talk to me or my son ever again” stuff with this smol blob. I love&nbsp;him. </p><p>a2: me too&nbsp;:&#8217;)</p><p><img data-media-id="54793766" src="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_18_1.png"/></p><p>Page&nbsp;143</p><p>a2: aaaaand one last gina panel to finish with. rose may have had her doubts about this contest at first, but as soon as dirk made a little creature with tentacles she&#8217;s like, fuck it, this is all i&#8217;ve ever wanted&nbsp;actually.</p><p>A1: She is gonna fuck this shit aaaallll&nbsp;up. </p><p>a2: and you are going to thank&nbsp;her.</p><p>See you next&nbsp;time!</p><a href="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_01_ecto-alchemology machine concept.png"></a><a href="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_02_terezi new.png"></a><a href="../../posts/sketches-and-4-34228399/34228399_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 4, The Contest_03_rose new.png"></a>
