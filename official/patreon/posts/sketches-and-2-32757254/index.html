If you hate Vriskas, well. Here is another one that is kind of different. Feel free to contemplate nature vs nurture and how best to apply this dichotomy toward emoting about the vriskas of your choice how you see&nbsp;fit.</p><p><img data-media-id="50287954" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_06_1.png"/></p><p>59) Runner up nickname was <span class="caps">VSCA</span>. Not sure how long that social media platform will be relevant, but Vrissy’s e-girl look is sure to be timeless. Since Homestuck characters never change clothes or&nbsp;anything. </p><p>“Rich Auntie Crocker” comes from me calling Jeff Bezos “Rich Uncle Jeff” to dissuade myself from purchasing any of his online wares and contributing to his hoard. It has a nice petulant, dismissive flavor to it. Feel free to pick it&nbsp;up.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288012" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_07_1.png"/></p><p>60) Tavros being named Tavros sure was a decision. Go back and reread the commentary for panel 58 but stop before the nature/nurture thing, since they are not clones, or even the same species. They just have the same name, which, in this universe, means you at least type kind of the&nbsp;same.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288023" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_08_1.png"/></p><p>61) Oh you wanted me to talk about vriska’s feelings about the prospect of seeing tavros? Well, sorry. That’s too complicated a thing to put in some bullshit ramble,&nbsp;huh.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288037" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_09_1.png"/></p><p>62) Is this the first instance of a flying car since John did the windy thing and made his dad’s car fly? I guess there was a flying car in Meat, but it was more circling a black hole in a deeply thematic way. You’d think we’d have more flying cars in our sci-fi future story. On that subject, you’d think we’d have more flying cars in our science-reality. Elon Musk sending a Tesla into space doesn’t&nbsp;count. </p><p>Oh yeah there’s Gamzee’s corpse too, I&nbsp;guess. </p><p><img data-media-id="50288050" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_10_1.png"/></p><p>63) What a hopeful, guileless&nbsp;face. </p><p><img data-media-id="50288062" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_11_1.png"/></p><p>64) ah,,, oh no, the&nbsp;guile</p><p>I deeply appreciate how Xam drew Tavros leaping back against the car while it is still in the&nbsp;air. </p><p><img data-media-id="50288086" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_12_1.png"/></p><p>65) Sometimes you try and come up with something to say about a page, and you cannot, and so you wait 8 hours, and go see Knives Out, and then you have 2 white russians, and then you still can’t come up with anything to say, but oh well! Commentary needs writing. Tavros is experiencing an emotion&nbsp;here.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288092" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_13_1.png"/></p><p>66) Stay back and let him feel&nbsp;it. </p><p><img data-media-id="50288099" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_14_1.png"/></p><p>67) Polite and charismatic, this crew, that is what they all&nbsp;say.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288165" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_15_1.png"/></p><p> 68) are we really supposed to say shit about every&nbsp;panel</p><p><img data-media-id="50288180" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_16_1.png"/></p><p>469) Ah here we have our first outfit change in homestuck squared. Watch me eat my earlier words about characters not changing&nbsp;clothes.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288231" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_17_1.gif"/></p><p>70) Help me god, deliver me from&nbsp;commentary.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288238" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_18_1.png"/></p><p>71) Here he comes, an incredible boy. Look into his eyes. This is the face of a boy who deserves to trend on&nbsp;twitter. </p><p>Which he did, kicking off what we’ve dubbed The Great Boomer Catfish of 2019. I’m not sure what they thought was happening, but damn were they mad. Maybe they thought he’d risen from the dead or someone had robbed his&nbsp;grave. </p><p><img data-media-id="50288254" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_19_1.png"/></p><p>72) Again, direct your eyes toward the boy. What a fucking asshole. Observe how ready he is to play along with Vrissy’s bullshit. How supportive. How chic. How&nbsp;cool.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288261" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_20_1.png"/></p><p>73) if this is the back of the school, imagine how nice the front&nbsp;looks. </p><p><img data-media-id="50288266" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_21_1.png"/></p><p>75) who is driving? I guess space cars are self driving. Look at Tavros riding in the back seat like a mother fuckeing gentleman. Anyway do you ever see two vriskas side by&nbsp;side?</p><p><img data-media-id="50288288" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_22_1.png"/></p><p>76) Tavros Crocker, master of&nbsp;blackrom. </p><p><img data-media-id="50288333" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_23_1.png"/></p><p>77) meeting alt selves&nbsp;UuU</p><p><img data-media-id="50288341" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_24_1.png"/></p><p>78) I love a moving plot. It’s&nbsp;sexy.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288353" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_25_1.png"/></p><p>79) Vriska is on the move. She is in her element. A plan is happening. A clown is dead. People are following her lead. I think it is very important that Tavros is homeschooled. This is representation. He does not know what the fuck is going on and you can just tell him whatever and he will believe&nbsp;it.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288357" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_26_1.png"/></p><p>80)&nbsp;Gadzooks.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288362" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_27_1.png"/></p><p>81) If you don’t like hijinks, fuck&nbsp;you. </p><p><img data-media-id="50288420" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_28_1.png"/></p><p>82) Pokedex entry for Magneton in Pokemon Sun: When three Magnemite link together, their brains also become one. They do not become three times more&nbsp;intelligent.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288434" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_29_1.png"/></p><p>83) Do you ever turn into a vampiric cave salamander and hiss every time you are forced to look at the light of your computer screen, showing an image of a page you can think of nothing new to say anything about? What more can you want from me, you&nbsp;monsters.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288514" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_30_1.gif"/></p><p><img data-media-id="50288518" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_31_1.gif"/></p><p><img data-media-id="50288522" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_32_1.gif"/></p><p>84) What fucking more can you possibly want. There is a dead ass in this&nbsp;one. </p><p>85) As the artistic integrity degenerates, so does my capability to form words. You are paying for this and you like it. You love it actually. You should probably up your&nbsp;pledge.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288545" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_33_1.gif"/></p><p>86) This is all you fucking wanted. This is all any of us have ever&nbsp;wanted.</p><p><img data-media-id="50288674" src="../../posts/sketches-and-2-32757254/32757254_Sketches and Commentary_ Chapter 2, Clown Logistics_34_1.png"/></p><p>87) There is lore for these guys and you will get it when I am good and ready.
