          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-09-06 17:31">i once made a zine via kinkos as a teen. i miss those times</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-09-06 17:31">really felt like i was doing something quite subversive</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-09-06 17:36">it was this completely insane, like actually incomprehensible thing</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-09-06 17:36">it included a few comics, one was a cyberpunk type comic about mr. T which i made</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-09-06 17:36">the rest was... I don't even know. like ripped out bits of magazines to make almost ransom note-style graphics, resulting in ludicrous articles about, like, nothing?</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-09-06 17:36">then we (me and my cousins) drove around the city trying to put it in stores, like inside storefront windows and such</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-09-06 17:36">and most people just kicked us out</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-09-06 17:39">i learned some things about society i guess</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-09-06 17:40">most businesses do not cotton to this. like literally just fucking banks and shit we would walk into with great aplomb, and begin positioning our literature as if mandated by the president to do so</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-09-06 17:40">it didnt really fly</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-09-06 17:40">but on the other hand, the dude at kinkos gave us all the copies for free, because he wanted to "encourage stuff like this"</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-09-06 17:42">to be honest, we didnt even try much very hard, or intelligently</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-09-06 17:42">because we all knew it was fucking trash</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-09-06 17:42">we just tried whatever, until we ran out, and went home</discord-message>

          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-18 14:51">its all grotesquely psychologically incestuous</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-18 14:51">thats why theres so much incest in hs i guess</discord-message>

          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-18 15:08">the epilogue is just a vriska, in story form</discord-message>

          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-23 12:36">ive been trying to make some recent effort toward the intellectual advancement of these clown ambitions</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-23 12:36">my latest thinking is that maybe it makes the most sense if the endeavor revolves around some sort of charitable cause</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-23 12:36">because at some point, one really has to ask. why the fuck are you trying to release more clowns into the world? is this actually responsible?</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-23 12:38">so you can either take your radioactive clowns and bury them in the earth under miles of concrete</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-23 12:38">OR</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-23 12:38">you can turn their radioactive properties into a force of good and change</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-23 12:38">sometimes radiation results in positive mutations</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-23 12:40">we want a bunch of fuckups at a cheap soviet facility to mishandle clown safety procedures, resulting in a massive, highly comical meltdown</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-23 12:40">ok, maybe that goal is too literal</discord-message>
          <hr>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-23 12:49">i dont "actively" rap. insofar as i dont think i have ever spoken a real rap out loud in my life</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-23 12:49">but ive written plenty of lyrics</discord-message>
          <hr>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-23 13:08">ive basically done a huge amount of work already, and somewhat illogically, conceptually tying juggalos to weed</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-23 13:08">420 is weed day, but its also clown day</discord-message>

          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-23 14:05">not to make everything about homestuck</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-23 14:05">except that everything actually is about homestuck</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-23 14:05">so whatever</discord-message>
          <hr>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-26 11:19">also it will be assisted by the knowledge that cancellation isnt even quite real</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-26 11:22">if left to my own devices i will just never, ever stop thinking of ways to torment and shit on jake english</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-26 11:22">hes just tavros 2.0</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-26 13:53">this is probably going to result in some chaotic discussions</discord-message>
          <hr>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-29 21:21">GUYS, THIS IS FUCKED UP. WE JUST HAD TO PUT OUR UNIVERSE INTO HOSPICE CARE</discord-message>
          <hr>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-29 21:24">maybe this is why communism fucking sucks actually. it all sounds good, but then they have to do shit, and all they do is right callout posts about eachother</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-29 21:24">same as it ever was</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-29 21:27">i think its probably just a universal constant that left wing personalities are just complete and total disaster people, and we need to make peace with that</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-29 21:31">see, this is why the left needs a massive clown movement to put wind in its sails</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-29 21:31">so that we can lionize literal clowns</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-29 21:31">as a huge dunk on the right</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-07-29 22:14">theres been an idea coalescing in young fandom which has been kind of difficult to deal with while still trying to make fictional content. which seems to be "the moral values of childrens media" should be conflated with "the moral values of any given piece of media"</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-29 22:14">when a critical mass of young people start really believing and enforcing that, it gets kind of tough to keep making challenging things</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-07-29 22:14">which is kind of unfortunate, because making challenging stuff is the only way to make impactful statements about the important topics which they say they hold dear</discord-message>

            prefaced i guess by some sort of statement like, andrews philosophy is that making "posts online" is for basic bitches, and true visionaries only communicate through an unfathomable pattern of performance art and loosely coordinated spokespeople

          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-08-25 14:42">
            yeah. i think it can be interesting to play with official dispatches of info, ways to disseminate messages from a creator, almost as much as playing with the media in question
          </discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-08-25 14:42">
            ill probably consider more methods like that

          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-08-25 14:42">
            such as putting 20 toblerones in a box, near a cave

          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-08-25 14:47">
            even though my thing was 2500 words, its still relatively brief compared to what could be said in a clarifying way. but i kinda think you just cant say too much at once sometimes, or the message disappears

          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-08-25 14:47">
            but i think there are more points to be made about like, "authoritativity" when it comes to how fans perceive some works of fiction as more legitimate than others, and how there are a lot of illusions about that which can be poked at
          </discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-08-25 14:47">
            people whove been writing works for marvel characters for the last several decades literally have been writing fanfiction. theres literally nothing to distinguish what they are doing from fanfiction, except a big corporation (run by people who also had nothing to do with these characters) is saying "this is more legitimate than anything you are doing out there"
          </discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-08-25 14:47">
            which is sort of insane, that a corporation has a magic wand to tell you what forms of art are more important than others

            they talk a good game about how disney sucks or whatever, but then turn around and start talking about media in this very formalist way that implies they agree with corporations defining the legitimacy of whats real vs fake

          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-08-26 12:37">i have thought about this much, this topic of over many years, which is something like "why do i do bad shit sometimes when i know its bad, and i know ill get destroyed for it"</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-08-26 12:37">and i think the most constructive answer is that its was always partially an exercise in disarming my own fragility</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-08-26 12:37">which, i think has a lot of value if you actually want to be honest in confronting dark topics, within yourself and otherwise</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" message-body-only timestamp="2019-08-26 12:37">but, if youre too scared or anxious you kinda cant do that. you can never go hard enough in art to create those revelatory experiences for yourself</discord-message>
          <discord-message profile="andrew" timestamp="2019-08-26 12:46">but for me personally at lease, looking back on everything, i think there was a lot of value in doing all this shit which essentially worked to tear down my ego a bit, and other barriers which prevent you from being fully honest about the stuff you make</discord-message>
