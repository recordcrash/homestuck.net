## About the project

Homestuck.net is a static website that serves as an archive for the Homestuck fandom. The archive is composed of a variety of HTML pages that link to audio, video, images, and text that the Homestuck fandom wants to preserve. Homestuck is a webcomic created by Andrew Hussie that was popular during the mid-2010s. The webcomic has a large and active fandom, and the Homestuck.net archive is an effort to preserve and celebrate the creative works of this fandom.

The archive is maintained by a group of volunteers who are passionate about preserving the Homestuck fandom's creative output. The archive includes fan art, fan fiction, music, cosplay, and other creative works. We believe that the Homestuck fandom has produced some of the most innovative and interesting fan works of any fandom, and we are committed to preserving these works for future generations of fans to enjoy.

We welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in helping to preserve the Homestuck fandom's creative output. Whether you're a fan artist, a writer, a musician, or just a fan who wants to help out, we would love to hear from you. The best way to do so is to click on the Homestuck Discord button and look for an admin.
